Unlike magical illusions, mirages cannot be dispelled, though some of them can be disbelieved. Mirages take two primary forms: the traditional mirage and the phenomenon known as heat haze.</p>\n<p>Traditional mirages are long-distance phenomena in which hazy images appear on the distant horizon, often in the shapes of rock formations, flat pools of reflective water, or oases and city walls. These mirages pose the greatest threat to travelers suffering from dehydration (whose desperation may persuade their minds to believe in an otherwise obvious mirage), or to those using the desert’s few landmarks as navigation aids. When navigating in the desert, the existence of a mirage imposes a –2 penalty on Survival checks to keep from getting lost.</p>\n<p>Because mirages are created by light refraction and not magical manipulation of the environment, they’re very difficult to distinguish from true structures or terrain features without the aid of magical divination or trial and error. Spells such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.jbqo4o2b2tmdz7wv]{True Seeing}, which reveal things as they truly are, indicate a mirage’s true nature but can’t reveal what the mirage is obscuring because of the distance (generally several miles) at which the phenomena are observed.</p>\n<p>Outside of magical means of detecting a mirage, a character must interact with the illusion to disbelieve it. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Survival check while observing a mirage can estimate the perceived distance to the image.

During the day’s hottest points, when hot air rises and cooler air above it sinks, this causes the air to appear to shimmer. This type of mirage can be seen from as little as 30 feet away. In conditions of heat haze, creatures beyond 30 feet appear indistinct, as though affected by the @Compendium[pf1.spells.18kryvj2dfuymk9d]{Blur} spell, and gain concealment against ranged attacks.

{"name":"Radiation","content":"<p>Radiation is a deadly threat to those who would explore the ruins of lost civilizations, and even in wasteland areas that appear devoid of strange artifacts, the land, the water, or the local flora and fauna may be irradiated. Even mild levels of radiation that would be harmless if encountered briefly may build into dangerous levels over cumulative periods of sustained or repeated exposure.</p>\n<p>Radiation is a poison effect, whose initial effect causes Constitution drain and secondary effect causes Strength damage. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: <em>low, medium, high, </em>and<em> severe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Area of Effect: </strong>Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. Each increment up to an equal length beyond that radius degrades the radiation strength by one level. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation 21 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation from 41 to 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Effect:</strong> Radiation initally deals Constitution drain unless the exposed character succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. A new saving throw must be attempted to resist radiation's initial damage each round a victim remains exposed to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Effect: </strong>Secondary effects from radiation deal Strength damage at a much slower rate than most poisons. This secondary effect ends only after a character succeeds at two consecutive Fortitude saving throws to resist secondary radiation damage. If a character has Strength damage equal to his current Strength score, further damage dealt by a secondary effect is instead Constitution damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Removing Radiation Effects: </strong>All radiation damage is a poison effect, and as such it can be removed with any effect that neutralizes poison. Ability damage and drain caused by radiation damage can be healed normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Radiation as Terrain: </strong>While traveling in the wastes, radiation may appear as a terrain hazard. In these cases, the radiation occupies the entire map cell, with the appropriate radii listed on the table below.

{"name":"Pyroclastic Flow","content":"<h2>Lava</h2>\n<p>Lava or magma deals [[2d6]] points of fire damage per round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals [[20d6]] points of fire damage per round. Unlike other forms of elemental damage, objects take full damage from lava or magma.</p>\n<p>Damage from lava continues for [[1d3]] rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during actual contact (that is, [[1d6]] or [[10d6]] points per round). Immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity or resistance to lava or magma. A creature immune or resistant to fire might still drown if completely immersed in lava (see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.FjcLzjjWfJ47YGCs]{Drowning}).</p>\n<p>Lava flows are usually associated with nonexplosive eruptions, and can be a permanent fixture of active volcanoes. Creatures overrun by a lava flow must make a DC 20 Reflex save or be engulfed in the lava. Success indicates that they are in contact with the lava but not immersed.</p>\n<h2>Lava Bombs</h2>\n<p>Blobs of molten rock may be hurled several miles from an erupting volcano, cooling into solid rock before they land. A typical lava bomb strikes a point designated by the GM and explodes in a 30-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take [[4d6]] points of damage. Creatures under cover or capable of covering themselves (like with a shield) gain a +2 bonus on this save. Particularly large lava bombs might sometimes occur, dealing [[12d6]] points of damage.</p>\n<h2>Poisonous Gas</h2>\n<p>One of the more insidious threats of a volcano is toxic gas, often escaping notice amid the fire and destruction. A wide variety of poisonous vapors can result from a volcanic eruption, some visible, some unseen. Poisonous gas causes [[1d6]] points of Constitution damage per round if inhaled (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save), and visible gases also function as heavy smoke. Poisonous gas clouds flow toward low ground, and are typically 50 feet high. Gale-force winds can divert gas clouds, as can high barriers—provided the gas has somewhere else to go.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.noQJPTIWs5VrTrmY"}},"_id":"yQO9N4ILQfRPSSmj"}
