Roll a [[d80]] to determine the type of fog (hungry mists can never be a ming fog).</p>\n<p>In addition to the fog rules, hungry mists drain all energy from creatures and items within it. All mundane fires go out over a period of 10 minutes, and restarting them proves impossible. Magical fire is entitled to a saving throw to maintain itself once every 10 minutes.

Answers other than a simple yes or no are expressed in vague terms.</p>\n<p>These voices never rise above the level of a whisper, as though they were originating from some distance away. Some travelers find them extremely disturbing despite their helpfulness because, once the voices are provided with water, they continually clamor for more.

{"_id":"z90KAbtBmHQJskbH","name":"Fuelstorm","content":"<p>Few things terrify the wastelanders of Odium more than a fuelstorm. When you see roiling, menacing, furious clouds of dark purple and deep black, dressed at the edges with a rich and energetic orange, that is the time to run as fast as you can, for a fuelstorm is exactly what it sounds like - a thunderstorm that rains guzzolene.</p>\n<p>A fuelstorm behaves in all ways like a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-weather-events.hfZian60GJPODiLF]{Thunderstorm}, with the key difference being that it rains highly flammable liquid fuel instead of water. The area can quickly become saturated with guzzolene, causing a chain reaction in the event of even the tiniest spark or flame (or lightning strike!) that could set entire landscapes on fire, and in particularly dense fuelstorms, the fire can even chase the falling fuel back up into the sky, creating great columns of fire that rise into the heavens and detonate the very clouds themselves.</p>\n<p>Additionally, any characters without sufficient breathing filters are subject to the fumes of guzzolene (see Fuel section under @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.K0ygnJNiFu1khvSw]{Items, Modifications, &amp; Equipment}) while within the area of a fuelstorm.</p>\n<p>Any open water supplies become contaminated immediately (less than 1 minute of rain) during a guzzolene storm. While the fuel itself can be siphoned off, the water remains undrinkable unless purified.</p>\n<p>On top of all this, guzzolene is a corrosive material that can deal damage to a large variety of materials. Any parchment or delicate cloth is destroyed if saturated with guzzolene. Vehicles can experience issues with seals and weatherstripping after surviving a fuelstorm (if it's anything more than a smoldering wreck afterward). Any food or tobacco items or other consumables not sealed in a watertight container are ruined, and consuming them has the same effect as drinking guzzolene. The GM may rule that other objects or materials are adversely affected by prolonged contact with guzzolene as the situation requires.</p>\n<p>After the fuelstorm has ended, the fuel evaporates very quickly. It begins to evaporate at a rate of 1 gallon per round from any unsealed containers that it may have happened to collect in, and disappears completely from the ground in only [[2d6]] rounds.</p>\n<p>Sometimes guzzolene may stick around on the ground for some time without evaporating, leaving a very thin oily film. This film is colloquially known as a guzzolene rainbow due to its colorful appearance. Some local Odium legends tell that when a guzzolene rainbow lasts longer than a few minutes, it's daring you to race it to the end before it can disappear, and that following it to its end will lead you to something important.</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"gm-notes":{"notes":"<ul>\n<li>Lok: The location of Key.</li>\n<li>Louie: The location of the Syndicate's home base.</li>\n<li>Magpie</li>\n<li>Pronto: The location of the Giga-Hog.</li>\n<li>Raven</li>\n<li>Seti</li>\n<li>Turnover</li>\n</ul>"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.DCnJqtoEWZbvsIxi"}}}
