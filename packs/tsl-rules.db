{"_id":"2jhFmGAS3oOntIAW","name":"Vehicles - Trailers","content":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Trailers\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EPdMWRFoQcH9SgBecKxU4q6k523FThdzcZ7BVcg9mrM/edit?usp=sharing\">Trailers</a></strong></p>\n<p>For vehicles that have enough power to pull more than their own weight, one of the easiest ways to drastically increase their utility is by towing a trailer. Like parasite vehicles, trailers are not able to move under their own power - in fact, they are considered separate from parasite vehicles because they are entirely unpowered. In order to move, an external force must act upon them. Usually, this is another vehicle pulling them, or gravity.</p>\n<p>Like other vehicles, trailers have a <strong>Size</strong>, <strong>Classification</strong>, <strong>Weight</strong>, and <strong>Cost</strong>. They additionally have a <strong>Capacity</strong>, which is the maximum weight the trailer is able to tolerate. They are able to support @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.LdfNkCeMnbYzUwaX]{Hardpoint} modifications, and unless otherwise specified in their entry, they have one Hardpoint equal to their Size just as any other vehicle by default.</p>\n<p>A vehicle is only able to haul trailers of the same or lower Classification, even if it has enough power to haul it. A vehicle may haul (or, at least, attempt to) haul as many trailers as it has the power to move - they can be hooked up to the same prime mover in a chain of trailers called a “road train.” Hooking up a trailer to a vehicle requires 1 minute for Steamhorse or Auto trailers, and 15 minutes for Heavy trailers. Unless otherwise specified, trailers can be assumed to be Open-Top vehicles.</p>\n<p>A vehicle that could ordinarily power itself can be towed while in an unpowered state - in these cases, the unpowered vehicle is treated as a trailer of its size and classification.</p>\n<p>Being meant for utility, each type of trailer is designed around a specific purpose, and may have special rules as a result.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"6\">Trailers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Trailer</td>\n<td

vehicles all around the continent using these specialized trailers. This two-layer trailer has strong metal ramps and hydraulic lifts to carry vehicles stacked atop one another without risking damage to them. Auto-carrier trailers are broken into four Huge Hardpoints by default, with each intended to hold a single Auto.</p>\n<p><strong>Box:</strong> These small, enclosed trailers offer an affordable solution for an Auto pilot to transport cargo. It has one Door at the rear of the trailer, and has 675 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p><strong>Bus-Body:</strong> If there are no buses available, these trailers are a great option for transporting people in relative comfort. This Hard-Top people-mover looks for all the world like a Bus with the pilot seat and engine removed. They have a Crew Capacity (no pilot or operator required in the trailer itself) equivalent to that of a Bus - 15 rows of 4 seats.</p>\n<p><strong>Chariot:</strong> These standing carts were traditionally pulled by horses, but the enterprising steamhorse pilot has started attaching them to their hogs as well. The chariot comes with a set of extensions that allow the steamhorse to be controlled from the chariot, allowing them to pilot the vehicle from the chariot rather than the steamhorse.</p>\n<p><strong>Dump:</strong> These trailers are used to transport loose cargo such as soil, building materials, or grain. They can lift from the front (near the rig pulling it), with a raising door at the back lifting to allow the material to be poured out of the rear of the trailer. If its Capacity is exceeded, the hydraulic lift will not be able to dump the load. Lifting the trailer and fully dumping the load takes 1 minute. Dump trailers have 650 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p><strong>Flatbed:</strong> These long, flat trailers make it easy to haul awkward cargo that can’t easily fit into other trailer types. This makes them one of the most flexible trailers available.</p>\n<p><strong>Hopper Bottom:</strong> These specialized trailers act much the same as dump trailers, and are often used for the same type of cargo. The primary difference is that they dump their loads through a hatch at the bottom, which always allows them to unload their cargo - even when overloaded. They have 650 cubic feet of cargo space, and can unload their cargo in 5 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Livestock:</strong> So-called because they are typically used to transport cattle, livestock trailers are often repurposed as mobile semi-armored platforms for infantry to shoot from. They are multi-tiered Hard-Top trailers with many slots cut into the side, allowing ranged weapon users a number of “murder-holes” to shoot out of while still providing decent cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Lowboy:</strong> These highly-specialized flatbed trailers are designed to carry extremely heavy loads more efficiently. They feature a low-swept deck that lies below the axles, which results in a 25% reduction in the felt Load on the pulling vehicle for cargo on the trailer. Another benefit that really only shows itself out in the wastes is that the low profile doesn’t allow climbing or driving underneath the trailer.</p>\n<p><strong>Rickshaw:</strong> These two-wheeled passenger wagons are pulled behind a ground Steamhorse. When attached, it increases the vehicle’s Crew Capacity by adding an extra row of +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Siege Weapon Carriage:</strong> These wheeled carriages are designed to make it easy to transport a siege weapon, then quickly set it up for use and pack it up for transport again. They are typically dragged behind a vehicle by their tail - a long, heavy piece of metal used as a counter-weight. While siege weapons are not usually fired while being transported, brave crews have proven it both possible and effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Tank:</strong> There is but one option to transport loose liquids by road - these large, cylindrical Hard-Top trailers can hold 6,500 units of liquid of any sort safely while under pressure. They are capable of holding flammable or other unsafe liquids as well as potable liquids, though the latter might not remain so without a thorough cleaning between hauls. </p>\n<p><strong>Van:</strong> Perhaps the most common trailer type, these massive enclosed box-style trailers can hold 3,950 cubic feet of cargo safely inside their Hard-Top structure. They have one Door in the rear, loading and unloading through the back.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.3YGaRa5LhyuHr6J5"}}}
{"_id":"5PRsKcEsizUcwGyz","name":"Vehicles - Body Descriptions","content":"<p><strong>Body:</strong> The cost for a vehicle Body is listed in the appropriate tables based on type and classification below. Unlike the other components, there are no base costs or modifiers for vehicle Bodies - the price listed is the final price. <br />        <strong>Crew Capacity </strong>is the arrangement and number of seats for the vehicle. They are presented as a list of numbers, each number representing a seat in the vehicle that can accommodate that number of passengers. Multiple rows of seats are represented by a + character separating each row. The sum total of these numbers represents the total number of occupants the vehicle can support. For example, a Crew Capacity of 3+3 would represent two seat rows, each seating three occupants, for a total crew capacity of six. Any additional occupants beyond this number cannot gain the benefits of being seated, such as being able to fasten a safety harness or access the vehicle controls.<br />        The <strong>Doors </strong>figure represents the number of doors the vehicle has that permit access in and out by crew. Typically, these doors are distributed evenly on the port and starboard (left and right) sides, with single remainders often situated at the rear of the vehicle or on the pilot’s side. Vehicles with zero doors have no inlet, usually requiring the occupants to jump in through the window. For this reason, vehicles with zero doors will usually also have an open top - if a vehicle has zero doors and a Hard Top, there is an additional 10 feet of movement required to enter the vehicle.<br /><strong>        Top </strong>states whether the vehicle has no top or a soft top (Open) or an enclosed cabin as part of the vehicle body (Hard). Occupants of vehicles with a Hard Top are protected from overhead area of effect attacks, and are considered to have total cover from above. They are also shielded from weather effects, such as rain or direct sunlight, as appropriate. Conversely, occupants of vehicles with an Open Top receive no protection from overhead attacks or weather effects, but all penalties on attack rolls and Armor Class from being in an enclosed space are halved.<br />        <strong>Weight </strong>is the total empty weight of an assembled vehicle in pounds. Additional modifications or other alterations that might affect weight will have their own weight attributes. The vehicle’s Weight does not include any potential cargo which, together with the vehicle’s Weight and the weight of all occupants, will contribute to the vehicle’s overall Load.<br />        <strong>Cargo Space</strong>, while not listed on the table, refers to the amount of total space the vehicle has dedicated to storing cargo. This is meant more as a guide for Game Masters to make judgment calls on what sort of content can fit in a vehicle, and unless otherwise specified, a vehicle is assumed to have 12 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <strong>Ground:</strong> The cost for a Ground Body is listed on the table Ground Body Style Costs.</p>\n<p><em>        Barchetta:</em> The barchetta is a small open-top, two-seater racing Auto. Only recently has the term begun to see use in the automobile industry - typically, the term is for small personal boats. There is little chance of confusion, however, given the low quantity of boats in The Sundered Lands.</p>\n<p>        Barchettas have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Big Axle:</em> One of the most insane vehicles ever devised, the big axle is little more than two massive man-sized wheels held together with a platform sitting close to the ground. The driver, madman that they are, stands on the platform and connects the wheels himself by sticking his arms into holds on either side, effectively making themselves the wheel.</p>\n<p>        Due to its bare-bones structure, the big axle has a base Armor rating of just 5 (from the large wheels on either side) and has no hit point value - instead, all damage it receives is done to its pilot as if the pilot themselves were the vehicle’s body. Its Armor Class is equal to its pilot’s Armor Class, but with a size penalty equal to the big axle’s. It provides cover to its pilot only from the sides, cannot be flipped, provides a 5% reduction in the vehicle’s Turning, and is capable of zero-axis pivot turns. The pilot of a big axle must use two arms and two legs to pilot the vehicle at all times.</p>\n<p>        Big axles have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Buggy:</em> The buggy, sometimes called the dune buggy or the sandrail, is a bare-bones Auto body that has stripped away everything that isn’t absolutely necessary in order to minimize weight and maximize speed. Often, this means no body paneling, and thus no armor.</p>\n<p>        Due to their stripped-down build, buggies have a base Armor rating of 0, 10 Hit Points, and provide no cover to occupants, but provide a 5% bonus to the vehicle’s Speed and a 5% reduction in the vehicle’s Turning (minimum -1).</p>\n<p>        Buggies have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Bus:</em> The bus is a large Auto designed to move a large number of passengers. Their seating arrangement features not only rows like other body styles, but in vertical columns as well. The Crew Capacity for this vehicle is listed as 1+(4x15). This represents the pilot in a seat by themselves, plus 15 rows seating 4. In the case of the bus, the seats of 4 are split into 2 seats, each seating 2 passengers, on either side of an aisle permitting crew to walk from the entire length of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>        The doors of a bus are also atypical. Instead of a door next to the pilot’s seat, the folding double-door is instead opposite the pilot, and is opened by the pilot with a lever. The second door is situated all the way at the back, and is used only as a second exit in case of an emergency. Some buses will also have hatches along the top, though these are not counted as true doors, and can only be opened from the inside.</p>\n<p>        Buses have 100 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Coupé:</em> The coupé is a sporty Auto, meant for fun and comfortable driving both in the city and on the country roads of Arlenia. In the much less pleasant Odium, it has instead found its place as a more solid, focused sprinter for scavengers who need something that can stand up to punishment and provide protection to its occupants than the more flexible but less protective Phaeton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Day Cab Rig:</em> If a rig is traveling only a short distance, the preferred choice is the day cab rig. Unlike the sleeper cab rig truck, the day cab rig truck has no attached cabin for resting while the vehicle is parked. The cabin is small and uncomfortable for resting, and the back wall is directly behind the seats, making it impossible to recline the seats. Anyone who sleeps in a day cab rig is automatically fatigued the next day.</p>\n<p>        Day cab rigs have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Double-Decker Bus:</em> If a bus can efficiently transport many passengers, then maybe stacking two buses on top of each other is even better. This does lead to a more complex Crew Capacity, being listed as 1+(2x(4x15)). As with the bus, the bottom floor is a lone pilot and 15 rows seating 4, divided into 2 seats which each support 2 occupants on either side of a walkway that runs the length of the vehicle. The double-decker bus will also have a small staircase or ladder leading to the second floor, which is a duplicate of the first floor (minus the pilot).</p>\n<p>        The first floor of a double-decker bus is always a Hard Top, but the second floor can either be an Open Top or Hard Top. This is determined at the time of purchase or discovery, and cannot be changed except through modification.</p>\n<p>        Double-decker buses have 100 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Open-Wheel:</em> When an Auto Body is built with the intent of creating the most optimized racing vehicle for paved tracks, the result is the Open-Wheel. These vehicles are notable for having the wheels unprotected by the body, and for having only a single occupant (the pilot) situated in the direct center of the narrow, streamlined body.</p>\n<p>        Open-Wheel vehicles gain a 5% bonus to Speed, but suffer double penalties and reduce all Integrity Resistance by 1 when dealing with any sort of difficult terrain or while “off-roading.”</p>\n<p>        Open-Wheel vehicles have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Phaeton: </em>The Phaeton is an open touring Auto meant for long-distance driving in style. They are heavy and have comfortable seats, which allows occupants to drive long distances without becoming tired or sore from the body moving constantly to react to inconsistencies in the road. In Odium, this trait makes them ideal vehicles for shooting while on the move. Occupants of a Phaeton have all penalties for attack rolls to fire on targets outside the vehicle halved.</p>\n<p>        Phaetons can also be purchased in the Double Phaeton and Triple Phaeton configurations using the Extra Seating (Phaeton) modification.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Pickup:</em> The Pickup, or “ute” as it is more commonly known in Odium, is a utility vehicle meant to transport small amounts of cargo and personnel. The flexibility and low cost of the Pickup makes it an invaluable and treasured vehicle in Bastion, where they can be seen even driving through the tight streets of the Steamgrates and Industria to perform vital tasks. The crew cabin of a Pickup is a Hard Top, but the cargo bed is Open Top, leaving its cargo vulnerable to weather, attack, and theft.</p>\n<p>        Pickups have 72 cubic feet of cargo space, but their open cargo bed permits them to carry more cargo uncontained by a roof.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Putter Pony:</em> The putter pony is a small, single-occupant steamhorse meant for short-distance traveling in tight, compact areas. They are a common sight in the Steamgrates and on The Slants, pulling small carts full of goods or transporting clients as a form of motorized rickshaw. They tend to have weak engines and are rarely seen outside of Bastion, as they cannot reliably outrun or defend against the considerable threats of Odium.</p>\n<p>        Putter ponies have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Quad:</em> The quad is similar to the steamhorse in its uses and capabilities, but differs from them in one key aspect - the quad has twice as many wheels. This gives them certain advantages in a number of situations, particularly in applications that require greater stability than what a steamhorse can provide. Quad pilots receive a +2 bonus on Pilot skill checks to maintain control on difficult terrain, and on any skill checks or saving throws made to prevent a wreck.</p>\n<p>        Quads have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Roadster:</em> The Roadster is a two-seat Auto with an open top and a slim frame, making it an ideal vehicle for hit-and-run tactics out in the wastes. These are frequently used to get up close on a prey vehicle and allow the passenger to board, then get away before suffering too much damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Sedan:</em> The sedan is what immediately comes to mind when one thinks of an Auto. Four doors, two rows of seats, and occupants separated from the engine separated from the cargo bay. These vehicles see frequent use by scavenger guilds as an efficient people mover, and are sought out by wanderers of the wastes for the extra space to store companions or gear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Sleeper Cab Rig:</em> Unlike a day cab rig, the sleeper cab rig truck is ideal for long hauls across the wastes and trips lasting longer than a single day. These huge trucks have an extension to their body, called a sleeper berth, that includes a small cabin, allowing the pilot and possibly even other passengers to sleep in relative comfort and safety. Some of these machines can sit at even the upper limits of the Heavy classification, bordering on becoming Ultras. A curtain or small door separates the seating from the sleeper cabin, preventing any nosy oglers on the outside from seeing if the truck is occupied.</p>\n<p>        Sleeper cab rigs have sleeper berths which permit passengers to sleep peacefully in motion for any length of time, regardless of their Suspension Dependency. Their berths average around 155 cubic feet of space, but using them to store cargo would not permit sleeping in the berth, thus mitigating the benefit of having the sleeper berth in the first place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Steamhorse: </em>The original motorized bicycle, the steamhorse has transcended being just a vehicle and has become the focal center of a number of growing cultural movements all over the tsl-content. Few vehicles can match the flexibility and potential of the noble steamhorse, leading to there being a configuration or model available for just about anything. They can be seen in Bastion performing any task imaginable, and their agility and speed on any terrain make them a must-have for surviving out woop woop.</p>\n<p>        Steamhorses have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Tank: </em>Rarely seen away from the Front, tanks are heavily-armored mobile fortresses that are terrifying to behold in battle. They are slow, cumbersome, and heavy - and tough and utterly unconcerned with nearly any obstacles in their path.</p>\n<p>        Tanks have a base Armor value of 30. As long as a tank’s chassis uses wheels, pedrail, tracks, or screws as locomotion, it is able to make a zero-axis pivot turn.</p>\n<p>        Tanks have 5 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Van: </em>Most simply put, the van is something like a snub-nosed, fully-enclosed Pickup. They are used to transport cargo as well as people, and they can be reconfigured on the fly depending on what role they might be serving at the time. Due to their cargo area always being enclosed, they are protected against weather and theft without needing a tonneau cover. This base flexibility comes at a price, though - they have far fewer options for modification than pickups.</p>\n<p>        Vans are able to remove their extra seating rows in order to increase their cargo space. By spending fifteen minutes, a technician with the proper tools can add or remove a row of seating, which in turn increases or decreases the Crew Capacity by 3, to a minimum Crew Capacity of 3 and a maximum of 3+3+3+3+3. For each row of seating removed, the van’s cargo space is increased by 60 cubic feet to a minimum of 200 cubic feet and a maximum of 500 cubic feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Wagon: </em>The wagon (shortened from the more proper “station wagon”) is something of a cross between the van and the sedan. In addition to having the same seating arrangement as a sedan, the station wagon has an attached cargo space that is considerably larger than the sedan. The fifth door is the hatch, which exposes the cargo area and permits a particularly flexible character to climb into the crew area over the cargo (space permitting).</p>\n<p>        Wagons have 24 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <strong>Aerial:</strong> The cost for an Aerial Body is listed on the table Aerial Body Style Costs.</p>\n<p><em>        Aerostat:</em> These smaller, softer cousins to the massive rigid airship offer an inexpensive but risky aerial transportation solution for those daring enough to ascend in one. These are best thought of as motorized hot air balloons, using a soft air bag filled with a lighter-than-air gas to float, with the engines powering propellers to move and turn. They are unarmored, and immediately start to fall if they take too much damage to their delicate balloons.</p>\n<p>        Aerostats have 5 Armor instead of the usual 15 for a Heavy classification vehicle. They are still considered Hard-Top vehicles, as their bodies are enclosed for the crew and cargo. Aerostats can go to Speed 0 without stalling, and are capable of hovering.</p>\n<p>        Aerostats have a notably smoother ride than other aerial vehicles, and permit passengers to sleep peacefully in motion for any length of time, regardless of their Suspension Dependency.</p>\n<p>        Aerostats are able to remove their extra seating rows in order to increase their cargo space. By spending fifteen minutes, a technician with the proper tools can add or remove a row of seating, which in turn increases or decreases the Crew Capacity by 2, to a minimum Crew Capacity of 2 and a maximum of 2+2+2+2. For each row of seating removed, the aerostat’s cargo space is increased by 50 cubic feet to a minimum of 200 cubic feet and a maximum of 350 cubic feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Biplane:</em> These airplanes have two pairs of wings, stacked on top of one another. This gives them more surface area to provide lift, allowing them to turn more tightly and move at a slower speed without stalling. Introduced just before the beginning of the War, they have mostly lost their popularity in favor of much more advanced modern monoplanes. Still, many find them far too useful to give up on just yet.</p>\n<p>        Biplanes enjoy a 20% reduction in their Stall Speed, as well as a 10% increase in their Turning.</p>\n<p>        Biplanes have 3 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Gyrocopter:</em> These quick and quirky aircraft look much like a libellule at first glance, if not for the large propeller sticking up on a pole into the sky. This propeller works in tandem with the rudder that provides forward thrust, allowing it to hover in place once airborne. It’s this flexibility that sees them used most often by messengers or those delivering small, important items over short distances with terrain too rugged for ground vehicles. Some believe their further development will result in an aircraft that can take off and land vertically without sacrificing the speed of an airplane.</p>\n<p>        Due to their stripped-down build, gyrocopters have a base Armor rating of 0, 10 Hit Points, and provide no cover to occupants, but can go to Speed 0 without stalling, and are capable of hovering. However, they cannot gain any altitude when hovering, just maintain it and move on the same vertical plane.</p>\n<p>        Gyrocopters have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Libellule:</em> Sometimes called cloud buggies, these small personal airplanes are considered by many to be the riskiest way to travel the skies. They manage to get and stay airborne mostly because they are so lightweight, typically because everything that isn’t absolutely essential has been stripped out of them, and because they are hardly larger than their pilot.</p>\n<p>        Due to their stripped-down build, libellules have a base Armor rating of 0, 10 Hit Points, and provide no cover to occupants, but provide a 5% bonus to the vehicle’s Speed and a 5% reduction in the vehicle’s Turning (minimum -1).</p>\n<p>        Libellules have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Megaplane:</em> These scaled-up monoplanes are used for jobs too big for ordinary monoplanes - bombing runs, troop transport, passenger flights, large cargo hauls. They offer a reasonable option to fill the gap between the lighter, swifter monoplane and the monstrous Ultra-tier gigaplane.</p>\n<p>        Megaplanes are able to remove their extra seating rows in order to increase their cargo space. By spending fifteen minutes, a technician with the proper tools can add or remove a row of seating, which in turn increases or decreases the Crew Capacity by 2, to a minimum Crew Capacity of 2 and a maximum of 2+2+2+2+2+2+2. For each row of seating removed, the megaplane’s cargo space is increased by 75 cubic feet to a minimum of 200 cubic feet and a maximum of 650 cubic feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Monoplane:</em> The quintessential aerial vehicle, monoplanes are the personal airplane seen in many a war film and poster swooping in to save the troops at the last moment. Whether it be scouting, bombing, dogfighting, or just to feel the freedom of flight, these versatile aircraft can do it all.</p>\n<p>        Monoplanes have 3 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <strong>Aquatic:</strong> The cost for an Aquatic Body is listed on the table Aquatic Body Style Costs.</p>\n<p><em>        Barge: </em>This long, flat boat can be thought of as a self-propelled aquatic flatbed truck trailer. It’s best meant to transport cargo over water, and little else is as effective as a barge in this - even Ultras that perform the same task are essentially just barges on much larger scales.</p>\n<p>        Barges are listed as having a Crew Capacity of 1, and indeed, this is all that is required to operate the vessel. However, barges can support any number of crew moving about their deck - they simply can only offer the benefits of being seated and strapped in to their pilot.</p>\n<p>        Barges are Hard Top only for their wheelhouse, a small structure around the helm to protect the pilot from the weather. Some barges are also adapted to be used for other purposes, like house boats or makeshift battleships - they may have additional Hard Top enclosures as well.</p>\n<p>        Barges have 100 cubic feet of covered cargo space in their enclosed wheelhouses; otherwise, they can carry as much cargo as they can fit on their decks uncovered.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Catamaran:</em> These unique boats have a distinct parallel hull design - instead of just one large hull, this ship is instead two hulls of equal size set beside each other and joined in the middle, so that water passes under the deck between the two hulls. The modern motorized catamaran is an adaptation of the Weheloan wa’a kaulua.</p>\n<p>        Catamarans have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Dinghy:</em> Used for centuries as rowing tender for larger vessels, dinghies in modern times have an outboard motor that gives them speed and agility.</p>\n<p>        Dinghies have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Runabout: </em>These small motorboats are well suited to carrying people across water comfortably. They’re often seen treating people to a relaxing day out on the water, but in places experiencing times of conflict, they serve the role of scouting craft and hit-and-fade striker craft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Skimmer:</em> These speedy little recreational watercraft are like steamhorses for the water. They are ridden by standing and holding onto a set of handlebars, though some may be driven seated and can seat extra passengers in a stack like steamhorses can. They frequently find their way into style competitions where pilots perform tricks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Thunderboat:</em> The fastest thing to be found on the water anywhere, thunderboats are specialized aquatic vehicles designed for one thing and one thing only: speed. These racing boats operate in a way not dissimilar to aircraft, with a special hull that forces water down as it travels, helping to lift the front of the boat out of the water and reduce drag.</p>\n<p>        Thunderboats have a 10% increase in both Speed and Turning. They have 0 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Yacht:</em> When one thinks of luxury watercraft, what usually springs to mind is the yacht. These ships come in all shapes and sizes, with some of the wealthiest individuals owning yachts that qualify as Ultras, but the most common yacht sits firmly in the Heavy class.</p>\n<p>        Yachts are listed as having a Crew Capacity of 1, and indeed, this is all that is required to operate the vessel. However, yachts can support any number of crew moving about their deck - they simply can only offer the benefits of being seated and strapped in to their pilot.</p>\n<p>        Yachts are Hard Top only for their cabins in the lower deck, which allow passengers on the vessel to sleep comfortably in an enclosed and safe space out of the weather. Yachts permit passengers to sleep peacefully in motion for any length of time, regardless of their Suspension Dependency.</p>\n<p>        Yachts have 100 cubic feet of covered cargo space in their enclosed cabins, though using it to store cargo prevents passengers from sleeping there; otherwise, they can carry as much cargo as they can fit on their decks uncovered.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.SdcXtZ7uPlcTlARj"}}}
{"_id":"8MAFpYXYpSpXieVu","name":"Vehicles - Transmission Descriptions","content":"<p><strong>Transmissions:</strong> The base cost for a transmission is listed on the table Component Costs - Transmission. Due to how the Engine and Transmission interact to determine the Speed and Torque values for the vehicle, a Transmission’s Power Transfer will always fall between 1 and 10. Some transmissions, however, are more flexible and are able to provide bonuses or even a range of Power Transfer stats depending on the situation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Manual:</em> The typical transmission attached to the overwhelming majority of vehicles in Bastion (and everywhere else), the manual is just that - a transmission that the driver must manually engage in order to change gears. A lever and a clutch pedal lead down to a metal case holding a series of gears, each of which engage with the rotating flywheel of the engine to provide power in a number of gear ratios to the drive shaft.</p>\n<p>        As the standard (also another name for them) for transmissions in Bastion, they provide no bonuses or penalties for their use.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Sequential: </em>The sequential transmission is the next step up from a manual transmission. It still requires the driver to manually change gears, but rather than the driver having to manipulate the clutch and gear shift lever themselves, they simply indicate to the transmission when to change gears, and then the transmission does so by itself with much greater speed and efficiency than any human could. It comes with either a set of paddles on either side of the steering wheel, or a simple lever where the gear shift once was. Tapping a paddle or pushing the lever up or down instructs the transmission how to shift, allowing the driver to focus on other aspects of driving.</p>\n<p>        Pilots using a sequential transmission gain a bonus on all Pilot skill checks equal to their own Intelligence bonus, minimum 1. Additionally, the Transmission gains 1 point of Integrity Resistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Horlogian: </em>If nothing else, the one thing that the horological engineers of Canton d’Horloge know more than anyone is gears. As an example of that expertise, they have developed the Horlogian Transmission, which is able to use a complex, finely-tuned series of gears and cogs to calculate the best times to shift and do so automatically, without any attention required by the pilot! These transmissions are notable for their complete lack of clutch or gear shift, replacing both with a small knob that tells the transmission whether it should travel forward, backward, neither, or just lock the transmission and prevent movement altogether.</p>\n<p>        Pilots using an horlogian transmission may always take 10 on Pilot skill checks, even if they are threatened or distracted. Additionally, the Transmission gains 1 point of Integrity Resistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Spectrum:</em> Rather than stepping through a number of fixed gear ratios like other transmissions, a spectrum transmission uniquely is able to transition smoothly and seamlessly between a range of gear ratios. It does this with an uncommon pulley design - rather than a single-piece pulley disc, the pulleys in a spectrum transmission are instead two spinning cones that run alongside each other. To change gears, the cones either move closer together or further apart, effectively changing the “diameter” of the pulley for the belt that runs between them.</p>\n<p>        The spectrum transmission has a Power Transfer value and a Fluid value. As a standard action, the vehicle’s pilot can shift the transmission’s Power Transfer value up or down by a number of points equal to or less than the Fluid value, up to a maximum of the Fluid value’s distance from the base Power Transfer value. This change lasts until the pilot shifts the Power Transfer value again, or until the vehicle powers down - it will be at its base Power Transfer value again when it next powers on. A spectrum transmission’s Fluid value will always be at least 1, up to a maximum of 3.</p>\n<p>        To calculate the cost to purchase a spectrum transmission, find the cost of each value as a separate transmission and add them together. Then, find the result of 10 to the power of the spectrum transmission’s Fluid value, multiply that by the Fluid value, and add it to the original sum.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Torque Converter:</em> Less a transmission and more a hydraulic coupling, the torque converter uses fluid to spin the drive shaft and transfer power to the wheels. The flywheel has an attached impeller, which throws a thick, viscous fluid against a fan on the drive shaft, turning the force of the thrown liquid into rotational energy as the fins of the fan deflect the liquid. In more complex units, additional discs in between can stage up the liquid to smoothly stage the increased rotation, creating a machine that is practically always at its ideal torque level. While the torque converter is an incredible piece of machinery, the effect is lost on vehicles of tremendous weight, thus limiting its use.</p>\n<p>        The torque converter has a Power Transfer value and a Fluid value. The lower of the two values is used when calculating the vehicle’s Speed; the higher of the two values is used for calculating the vehicle’s Torque. To calculate the cost to purchase a new torque converter, find the cost of each value as a separate transmission and add them together. Then, multiply that amount by the difference between the two separate Power Transfer values. This will be the cost in gp.</p>\n<p>        Torque converters are limited in their use to Steamhorses and Autos.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.2JniNSwRsFbTACqW"}}}
{"_id":"BkbGzqTSjkqWK7yy","name":"Dueling","content":"<p>Some, such as the nobility of Antquanettian-based societies and the samurai of Ijozora, believe strongly in the defense and maintenance of their honor (or, at least, the perception of their honor in the eyes of others). The most common way of defending that honor when one feels it has been besmirched is with the duel: a dramatic face-to-face confrontation in which each party attempts to force the other to submit to their demands or be subject to possible severe injury or even death.</p>\n<p>The process of conducting a duel is highly formalized in most cultures. Since duels are occasionally fatal to one or even both duelists, they are rarely provoked by minor insults or passing arguments. Each culture that utilizes dueling as a concept has a different process and tradition for how duels are carried out.</p>\n<p><strong>Antquanette and Arlenia:</strong> Only those holding a noble rank, by birth or otherwise, may challenge another (who must also be of noble rank) to a formal duel. Commoners will sometimes duel if they own suitable weapons, as will non-nobles of high repute, but it is technically illegal. Commoners may duel legally only if the initiator is challenging a man who has had carnal relations with his wife - he is allowed to retaliate against the man who has violated her.</p>\n<p>Most authorities will stop a duel between commoners if they know about it (not that this stops them from occurring), but the fear of backlash from the well-to-do keeps them from interfering with duels between the non-noble upper echelon. That said, most wealthy individuals will hold a noble rank anyway, typically given by the king and granting them entrance into a specific order. Only nobles may duel with pistols, as only nobles are permitted to own or carry handguns (and, in fact, they must carry a smoothbore dueling pistol at all times), except in Ataraxia, where anyone can legally own and carry a pistol, and on the outskirts of the Wanderer’s Desert, where everyone does anyway.</p>\n<p>To initiate a duel, the offended party must directly challenge the offending party, either verbally or in writing, in private or in public. The challenged can decline, but being a duel for honor, doing so sullies the challenged's honor and reputation, and implies to outsiders that the offending party's insults or claims against the offended party are baseless.</p>\n<p>When challenged to a duel, the challenged is permitted to select which weapon will be used. They may decide to fight with pistols or with swords. The pistols must be muzzle-loading, single-shot smoothbore pistols that satisfy the regulations. Swords must be fencing-style swords, such as a rapier. The challenged may make other suggestions outside of these two standard avenues to satisfying both parties' honor, but they are rarely suggested or accepted.</p>\n<p>Both parties are assumed to perform the duel themselves, but either party can propose the use of champions to replace them. In suggesting it, they open the other party to the option as well. If the offer to use a champion is declined, then neither may use champions and must settle the duel themselves. Once both parties have agreed to use a champion, the option cannot be revoked.</p>\n<p>All details are agreed upon by both parties before the duel takes place. It is scheduled, a location is chosen, their assistants and/or champions are announced, as well as the intermediary or judge. Whether an esoteric healer is present to tend to wounds afterward is also decided upon, and is considered the standard - though it may happen every once in a while, duels are not actually meant to be to the death.</p>\n<p>At any point, the one who delivered the first offense may issue an apology, written or spoken, public or private. The offended, should they accept, is expected to call off the duel, their honor being satisfied, and offer any apologies for insults they made in retort. The offended can refuse to accept the apology, but this is considered ungentlemanly when the apology is genuine.</p>\n<p><strong>Ijozora:</strong> The many complex cultural intricacies of Ijozoran high society make it difficult to avoid insulting someone in a way that might be taken as an attack against their honor. Thankfully, the warrior elite of Ijozora tend to be calm and collected, and refuse to allow a minor slight to drive them to emotional outbursts.</p>\n<p>When an Ijozoran samurai has been deeply wronged, however, and decides to challenge the offender to a duel, it is typically to an iaijustsu duel. Iaijutsu is the Ijozoran art of quick-draw sword combat, and the best Ijozoran samurai practitioners of this art are able to draw their sword so quickly that their opponent is slain before the eye even registers the movement.</p>\n<p>To initiate a duel, a samurai must first get his lord’s permission to issue the challenge. Since his life and body belongs to his lord, the lord must consent to a duel that could mean the loss of his property. If his lord agrees, the samurai seeks out his enemy and formally requests a duel, stating the reason for the challenge and precisely naming the terms of victory.</p>\n<p>If the second samurai is willing to fight the duel, he must ask his lord’s permission to accept. The challenged samurai may himself refuse to accept the duel, though this is not a particularly honorable course of action. His lord may refuse permission, or may name another samurai to accept the duel in place of the challenged samurai. Assuming permission is granted, the challenged samurai has the right to name the place where the duel will occur (always a public place, with witnesses from both sides), as well as the time (no more than one year in the future). If circumstances prevent one samurai from appearing at the appointed time for the duel, his lord may name a samurai to fight in his place.</p>\n<h2>Dueling Rules</h2>\n<p>After all of the organization has been accomplished and the time for the duel has arrived, the weapons for the duel are inspected by an intermediary (if that was part of the terms for the duel) to ensure that they adhered to the rules set forth by culture, terms of the duel, or both.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> In a duel, hit points work differently than they do in normal combat. The duel is a tense, potentially fatal moment of lightning-fast and all-out combat between the participant duelists. Unfortunately, the highly abstracted hit points system in Pathfinder and other d20-based games do not support this well - it’s hard to create an environment of tension and fear for the outcome of a duel when a single attack will almost never threaten the life of a character after a certain level and, thus, number of hit points have been accrued.</p>\n<p>In a duel, all damage dealt is instead treated as Constitution damage. This creates a situation where it is highly possible for a single attack by any combatant to threaten the life of another combatant, regardless of either’s level or class. However, they are still able to improve their defensive qualities during a duel - each combatant gains an amount of “temporary hit points” equal to their ranks in the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} skill. Before they take Constitution damage from an attack in a duel, these “temporary hit points” must first be depleted. These “temporary hit points” will henceforth be referred to as “dueling hit points.”</p>\n<p>A duel has two phases: the stand-off, and the strike. During the stand-off, the duelists face each other and study each other’s equipment, stance, and demeanor to assess their skill. The strike phase marks the beginning of the duel proper, wherein they make attacks against one another until either the duel is won, or is called off.</p>\n<p>Some duels, such as iaijutsu duels or the sort of pistol duels fought in the outskirts of the Wanderer’s Desert, see the opponents starting the duel with their weapons sheathed. In order to participate meaningfully in these types of duels, both duelists must have the Quick Draw feat. Spending a move-equivalent action to draw a weapon in the strike phase of a duel would almost certainly prove fatal. Specialized duelists master the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Stare Down:</strong> In the first round of a duel, the two duelists stand a few steps apart and appraise each other, looking for signs of their opponent’s skill, training, and reflex in their ready posture. Many duels go no further: one duelist concedes victory to the other, recognizing a clearly superior opponent. Conceding in this manner is not seen as dishonorable.</p>\n<p>When the duelists assume their stance, they each make a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} check. The check result determines how much information they discern about the other duelist (per the Size Up use of the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} skill), as well as how much bonus damage their first strike will deal (per the Bonus Damage use of the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} skill).</p>\n<p><strong>Strike:</strong> After both duelists attempt their @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} checks, they draw their weapons and strike. Each duelist rolls an initiative check, gaining a circumstance bonus on the check equal to their ranks in the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} skill. If they so choose, they may forego the initiative check to instead treat their @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} check result as their initiative check result.</p>\n<p>The first round of a duel’s strike phase is essentially a surprise round: each combatant can take only a standard action (usually an attack) in addition to drawing the weapon (a free action, assuming each duelist has the Quick Draw feat). With a successful hit, the winning duelist deals the bonus damage achieved through his earlier @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} check result, in addition to normal (or critical) weapon damage. The loser, if he is still standing, may choose to withdraw or continue with their attack. However, since they lost initiative and their opponent went first, they are no longer striking a flat-footed foe, and as such does not receive his @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} check bonus damage.</p>\n<p>If the difference of the initiative check results are less than 5, the initiative is treated as a tie, and the attacks are resolved at the exact same time. Both combatants are considered flat-footed, and both are entitled to bonus damage equal to their @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} check result (should they otherwise satisfy the necessary requirements to benefit from this bonus damage).</p>\n<p>After the initial round of the duel, the two duelists can continue fighting in normal combat, if both survive. Unlike normal combat, however, they may not take full attack actions - they are limited instead to standard action attacks only. They no longer receive any bonus damage dice to their attack rolls unless the circumstances under which @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} checks may be attempted somehow arise again in the course of the fight (the combat ends and one or the other returns his weapon to its sheath).</p>\n<p>Once either combatant withdraws from the duel, or a clear winner is declared, it is considered to be over. If their opponent continues attacking after the duel has been stopped in this manner, it is typically seen as highly dishonorable and (usually) an attempt to murder the opponent. This is occasionally seen in the form of the loser attacking the winner out of anger, when their back is turned. Each culture handles this differently, according to their own laws and customs.</p>\n<p><strong>Duel Bonus Damage in Normal Combat</strong>: You can use your @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} check bonus damage in normal combat too, but only when you are attacking a flat-footed opponent and you draw your weapon in the same round you strike. This means that a character with Quick Draw can use @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel} in a surprise round. A character without Quick Draw cannot strike an opponent in a surprise round if he begins the round with his weapon sheathed. </p>\n<p>In a normal first round of combat, a character whose initiative is higher than his opponent’s can draw a weapon, move to the opponent, and attack using @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.qM2ju0s0DE1aSAiU]{Duel}, as long as he has either Quick Draw or a base attack bonus of +1 or higher (so that he can draw his weapon while he moves).</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.OWIMA7ObdkKr07hO"}}}

They are considered <strong>Commonplace</strong> in the regions of Redlyn and Odium - early firearms cost 25% in these regions, and advanced firearms will cost the listed price. Some regions will see <strong>Emerging Guns</strong> (the Ijozoran tanegashima or the Baluuric jezail), with most of the rest seeing the burgeoning technology of firearms tangentially from outside visitors (<strong>Very Rare Guns</strong>), or not at all (<strong>No Guns</strong>).</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Firearm Rules</h2>\n<p><strong>Firearm Proficiency:</strong> Early firearms are treated as martial weapons. Martial weapon proficiency, granted either by class, by taking the Martial Weapon Proficiency (early firearms) feat, or by taking the Exotic Weapons Proficiency (firearms) feat, allows the character to use all appropriate firearms (except siege firearms) without penalty. A nonproficient character takes the standard -4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots they load.</p>\n<p>Even though the Martial Weapon Proficiency (firearms) and Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feats grant a character proficiency with some or all non-siege firearms, anytime the character takes a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as Weapon Focus or Rapid Reload), the character must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> A firearm’s capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time before needing to be reloaded. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit (or the weapon’s limit, if applicable), unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> All firearms do both Bludgeoning and Piercing damage unless stated otherwise in their entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Range:</strong> Early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of ten range increments.</p>\n<p><strong>Loading a Firearm:</strong> A character needs at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, the character holds the weapon in one hand and loads it with the other - they only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm. Loading siege firearms requires both hands, and one hand occasionally manipulates a large ramrod (which can be wielded as a club in combat). The Rapid Reload feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms (unless otherwise stated in the weapon’s entry), but this feat does not reduce the time it takes to load siege firearms.</p>\n<p>Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity, unless the reload takes only a swift or free action. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Early Firearms:</em> Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Advanced Firearms:</em> Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. The wielder of an advanced firearm may reload a number of rounds on each reload (move) action across all held firearms equal to one-half their Base Attack Bonus (rounded down) plus their Dexterity modifier. Weapons that can be drawn as a free action during a reload may also be reloaded during a reload action, even if they are not held.</p>\n<p>Regardless of action type, a player may make only one reload action per round. Some weapons have special reloading rules that differ from the rules above; details are listed in each weapon’s entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Misfires: </strong>If the natural result of a character’s attack roll falls within a firearm’s misfire value, that shot misses, even if the shot would have otherwise hit the target. Additionally, the shot threatens a chance at a misfire. To confirm whether or not the weapon misfires, the character makes another attack roll. If the natural result of the attack roll once again falls within the firearm’s misfire value, then the result is indeed a misfire. Otherwise, the weapon does not misfire - the attack simply misses. The ammunition expended on a misfire is lost.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Early Firearms:</em> If an early firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the gun wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm (see the Gunslinger class). In that case, the misfire value increases by only 2 instead of 4. If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a non-magical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can’t fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the Gunsmithing feat). When a gun explodes, pick a corner of the square it occupies - the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm’s wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon - a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage. This DC increases by +2 if the weapon is of masterwork quality, and by an additional +2 per magical enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls of the weapon.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Advanced Firearms:</em> Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they simply miss. Misfires do not bestow the broken condition on advanced firearms, and a further misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.</p>\n<p>One cannot misfire on a critical hit confirmation roll. If a character rolls a misfire when attempting to confirm a critical hit, it is treated as a normal result of the die (which may or may not confirm the critical hit).</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Unlike other types of ammunition, firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used, and has no chance of being retrieved on a miss. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison or oils, unless the character is using a pitted bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>Concealing Firearms:</strong> Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on one’s person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on one’s person.</p>\n<p><strong>Inappropriately Sized Firearms:</strong> A character cannot make optimum use of a firearm that is not properly sized for them. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the character’s size and the size of the firearm. If the character is not proficient with the firearm, a -4 non-proficiency penalty also applies. The size of a firearm never affects how many hands one needs to use to shoot it, the exception being siege firearms and Large or larger creatures. In most cases, a Large or larger creature can use a siege firearm as a two-handed firearm, but the creature takes a -2 penalty for using it this way because of its awkwardness.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Strength:</strong> Some firearms, such as the anti-materiel rifle and the big iron revolver, state in their entry that they have a minimum required Strength score. This means that the wielder must have a Strength score equal to or exceeding the listed number. If the user does not, they take a -8 penalty on the attack roll made with the weapon. Regardless of whether they succeed or fail, they drop the weapon immediately after the attack, as they are incapable of controlling the weapon’s intense recoil.</p>\n<p><strong>Bucklers:</strong> A character can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty with a buckler equipped.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire While Prone:</strong> Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Firearms, Black Powder, and Water</strong>: Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. A character cannot normally load or fire an early firearm underwater without magical aid. Advanced firearms can be fired underwater unless their entry states otherwise, but are subject to the usual penalties for attacking with a ranged weapon while underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Deflecting and Snatching Bullets:</strong> The Deflect Arrows feat and the Snatch Arrows feat can be used to deflect bullets and slugs, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon. Neither of these feats can be used to deflect siege firearm attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Suppressing Fire:</strong> Occasionally, it is more advantageous to keep an enemy pinned down than to try and shoot them directly. For these situations, shooters may choose to lay down suppressing fire as a full-round action. One or more shooters can concentrate fire on an area the size of a sphere, with a radius of 5 feet per participating shooter. The furthest point in the area of suppressing fire must be within the first range increment of all participants’ weapons. Any enemy within this area must make a Will saving throw to resist being pinned down, with a DC equal to one-half the result of a ranged attack roll made by the suppressing shooter, rounded down. This attack roll can include racial bonuses, bonuses for a masterwork or magic weapon, or circumstance bonuses, but not bonuses from temporary magic spells (such as the true strike spell). Only one shooter makes the roll, regardless of how many shooters are participating, but each participating shooter may use a special aid another action to grant the primary shooter a +2 bonus on the roll.</p>\n<p>On a success, the enemy is unaffected and can continue acting normally. On a failure, the enemy is pinned down and forced to stay behind cover relative to the shooters, unless a greater immediate threat presents itself should they not move from behind cover. This imparts a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. They may try to flee the area via the quickest route available to them if there is no cover available or if that is a shorter distance than the nearest suitable cover. Affected enemies within the area may attempt another Will saving throw as a move action at the start of their turn every round until they succeed or until the suppressing fire ends. Once a character has succeeded, they cannot be subject to that bout of suppressing fire again, but must save against future suppressing fire attempts, even if made by the same enemy during the same combat.</p>\n<h2>Firearm Descriptions</h2>\n<p>There are two general categories of firearms: early and advanced. Firearms are further divided into one-handed, two-handed, and siege firearms. As the category’s name implies, one-handed firearms need only one hand to wield and shoot. Two-handed firearms work best when using two hands while shooting them. Two-handed firearms can be shot with one hand at a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Siege weapons are typically mounted on some sort of platform, movable or otherwise, and have greater power but additional drawbacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Automatic Weapon Quality:</strong> A weapon with the automatic weapon quality is capable of firing multiple rounds with a single trigger pull. This grants the shooter extra attacks with the weapon - whenever making an attack with this weapon, the user may make one additional ranged attack, with all attacks that round suffering a -2 penalty to attack rolls.</p>\n<p>A shooter using an automatic weapon can lay down suppressing fire as a standard action without the assistance of other shooters. They may choose the size of the area to suppress, up to a maximum radius of 10 feet per point of their Dexterity bonus, minimum 10 feet. Additionally, they can choose to expend additional ammunition to increase the likelihood that the enemy remains pinned down - the Will saving throw DC to resist the effects of being pinned down increases by +1 for every round the shooter chooses to expend.</p>\n<p>Automatic weapons can also fire blindly and have a greater chance of hitting a protected or unseen target than precision weapons. If the wielder of an automatic weapon knows the location of an enemy within the weapon’s first range increment, but the wielder is subject to a miss chance against the target, the wielder may “spray and pray,” spending triple the amount of ammunition per shot attempted. This reduces the target’s miss chance by half. Even if the shooter hits, they are only considered to have hit once per shot, despite using triple the ammunition. Precision damage cannot be applied to successful attacks made during a spray and pray action. The wielder must have the available ammunition loaded into their weapon prior to making this choice - they cannot take a reload action in the middle of a “spray and pray” shot. If taken, a spray and pray attack must be applied to all firearm attacks taken in a turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Cut Weapon Quality:</strong> A weapon with the cut weapon quality can be modified to become a one-handed weapon by sawing off a significant portion of the barrel and stock. Doing so increases the misfire range by 2 and requires a Strength score of 13 to wield effectively. Attempting to use the weapon one-handed without the required Strength bestows a -4 penalty to attack rolls, increases the misfire range by an additional 2, and requires a DC 12 Strength check each time - failure means the user automatically misses on their attack and drops the weapon.</p>\n<p>Weapons with the cut weapon quality can be purchased in their typical two-handed form and cut down later, or purchased in their one-handed cut form at no additional cost. Once in their cut one-handed form, they cannot be restored to their two-handed form. </p>\n<p>Weapons with the cut weapon quality still require two hands to reload, unless their entry states otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Destructive Weapon Quality:</strong> A weapon with the destructive weapon quality is designed to wreak maximum destruction upon its target. Ranged weapons with the Destructive weapon quality do full damage against objects, and nullify an object’s immunity to critical hits. When rolling for damage, any die roll that naturally results in the maximum value for that die may be rolled again, with both results added to the total damage dealt for that attack. If that roll results in the maximum value for the die as well, it may be rolled again - this continues until no dice have come up on their maximum roll result.</p>\n<p><strong>Scatter Weapon Quality:</strong> A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise.</p>\n<p>The range listed for a Scatter weapon determines its normal range increment distance when firing normal bullets. When making a scattering shot, the size of the cone area it affects is equal to half its range increment.</p>\n<p>When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within the cone, it makes a single attack roll to determine whether the attack possibly misfires or scores a critical hit. If no misfire occurs, each creature within the cone must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 12 for one-handed firearms, DC 15 for two-handed firearms, DC 18 for siege firearms). This DC is increased by +2 if the weapon is of masterwork quality, and an additional +2 for each magical enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls. With a success, they take half damage. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. To confirm a critical hit, the attack is made against the Armor Class of the creature in the cone with the highest Armor Class. On a confirmed critical hit, the weapon deals its critical hit damage to all creatures in the affected area subject to damage, instead of normal damage. If the natural result of the attack roll falls within the misfire value, the weapon suffers a misfire as normal. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.</p>\n<p>When a scatter weapon uses a scattering shot attack on a single target within 5 feet, it can forfeit the cone area attack to instead be treated as if it has the Destructive quality when rolling damage against that target.</p>\n<p>Weapons with the scatter quality are not able to apply precision damage to their targets when making a scattering shot.</p>\n<p><strong>Early Firearms: </strong>Early firearms are typically matchlock, wheellock, or flintlock weapons, and require more finesse and care to use than advanced firearms. Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring a bullet and powder (or other special alchemical substances) to be shoved down the barrel before the weapon is fired. Early firearm ammunition can be loaded from a cartridge, but that cartridge is made of soft material (like paper or cloth) that is torn open so that the contents may be shoved down the barrel. Unlike advanced firearm cartridges, these cartridges do not protect the black powder inside from being exposed to water.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Firearms:</strong> Advanced firearms are more reliable and accurate than early firearms. The ammunition of an advanced firearm takes the form of metal (usually brass) cartridges that are loaded into a chamber rather than shoved down the barrel.</p>\n<h2>Siege Firearms</h2>\n<p>Siege engine firearms are large firearm weapons, temporary structures, or pieces of equipment used for damaging structures, vehicles, or large numbers of infantry at once.</p>\n<p>All siege firearms are at least size Large devices and often much larger. Unless stated otherwise in an individual siege firearm’s description, all siege firearms use the following rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiency:</strong> Firearms which count as siege weapons require their own special proficiency. In addition to being proficient with the type of technology in which that firearm is classified (early or advanced), the user must also have the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (siege engines) feat in order to be considered proficient. So, for example, a character with proficiency in all martial weapons (such as a fighter) and the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (siege engines) feat is considered proficient with all early siege firearms. However, only a character that has both the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (advanced firearms) and Exotic Weapon Proficiency (siege engines) feats can be considered proficient with advanced siege firearms. The penalties for nonproficiency do not stack for each lacking aspect of proficiency - if you are nonproficient, you are simply nonproficient, no matter how unqualified you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Crew:</strong> The sheer size and complexity of a siege firearm often necessitates a crew for its use. One person of that crew is the crew leader. Usually the crew leader targets or controls the firing of a siege firearm; sometimes the crew leader does both. Often the crew leader is required to take actions and make specific checks in order for a siege firearm to function. The rest of the crew members are required to spend actions and make checks in order for a siege firearmto function.</p>\n<p>The number of members in a crew assumes Medium creatures. A siege firearm can be crewed by Small creatures, but it takes double the crew to do the same job. If Large or larger creatures serve as crew members, each Large creature counts as four crew members, a Huge creature counts as eight Medium creatures, a gargantuan creature counts as 16 Medium creatures, and a colossal creature counts as 20 Medium creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical and Masterwork Siege Engines:</strong> Siege firearms can be masterwork, increasing their Craft DC by 5 and costing an additional 300 gp. A masterwork siege firearm can be enchanted at twice the cost for a normal magical weapon. The enhancement bonus of a siege firearm applies on attack rolls and targeting checks (in the case of indirect ranged siege firearms), and in the case of magical siege firearms, the enhancement bonus also applies on damage rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Defense and Hit Points:</strong> All siege firearms are objects. A siege firearm has a Dexterity of 0 (–5 penalty) and a further penalty based on its size. Each type of siege firearmhas its own hardness and hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving Siege Engines:</strong> Siege firearms have a speed. The speed of a siege firearm is the distance it can be moved if its full crew makes a move action to move it. Some siege firearms have a speed of 0. If this is the case, the siege firearm must be disassembled before movement is possible, or else mounted on a vehicle. Siege firearms that are atop or mounted on vehicles move with those vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> Unless otherwise mentioned in their description, siege firearms have the Destructive special quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Hits:</strong> When a direct-fire siege firearm scores a critical hit, it confirms the critical hit and deals critical hit damage just like any other weapon. If an indirect-fire siege firearm rolls a natural 20 on its targeting check, it can also score a critical hit. The crew leader must reroll the targeting check to confirm the critical. If the confirmation targeting check is successful, the attack is a critical hit, and the siege firearm multiplies its damage by its critical multiplier.</p>\n<p><strong>Range:</strong> Any attack at more than the distance listed in a siege firearm’s entry is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack or targeting check takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. Some siege firearms have a minimum range for effectiveness. If that is the case, the minimum range will be listed in the siege firearm’s description.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> All siege firearms deal bludgeoning and piercing damage, unless otherwise specified in their descriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong> This column gives the number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the @Compendium[pf-content.pf-feats.WXjodyIsjwT90iDe]{Master Siege Engineer} feat) required to aim a siege firearm. If the siege firearm is being controlled by less than its normal crew complement, the number of actions it takes for the crew to aim the siege firearm is doubled. Additionally, this column will say whether a siege firearm is direct (D) or indirect (I) fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Large Wielders:</strong> Large and larger creatures can wield an appropriately-size siege firearm as a two-handed weapon. They are still required to take the necessary reload and aim actions to use the weapon properly.</p>\n<h2>Explosives</h2>\n<p>Instead of using gas expansion to launch a directed projectile, explosives use the sheer concussive force of ignited powder to cause tremendous damage to an area. Many of these explosives can be thrown at targets, and doing so is similar to throwing a splash weapon (such that splash weapon feats can be used with explosives unless otherwise specified). Like a thrown splash weapon, thrown explosives require no weapon proficiency. Explosives cannot deal precision-based damage. Unless otherwise specified, an explosive is destroyed after it has been detonated and cannot be recovered. Like a thrown splash weapon, explosives are not considered ammunition, but rather a (consumable) weapon in their own right.</p>\n<p>Misfires work slightly differently for explosives. Explosives all have a default misfire value of 1, and are always considered to have the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. If an attack roll with an explosive threatens a misfire, but does not confirm it, the explosive fails to go off - it is simply a dud.</p>\n<p>All explosives are considered to have the Destructive weapon quality, unless otherwise noted in their description.</p>\n<p>Any explosives or pressurized canisters (such as hellbelcher tanks or a vehicle fuel tank) caught in the blast radius of an explosive also detonate, adding half their total damage dice rounded down as additional damage to the explosion each, and set off any explosives in their blast radius in a chain reaction. If those explosives are carried by another character, that character is subject to a DC 10 Reflex save to prevent their explosives from detonating. Additionally, any flammable material (vehicle fuel, unprotected black powder, etc) that takes fire damage may ignite or explode, potentially causing other explosives in their blast radius to explode as well.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.z0A41QYrn7u0kYCh"}}}

{"name":"Vehicles - Chassis Descriptions","content":"<p><strong>Chassis:</strong> The base cost for a chassis is listed on the table Component Costs - Chassis. The cost for chassis that exceed a Brakes rating of 10 is, like the rest of the Brakes ratings, 50 gp per point of Brake. Chassis also have several different considerations: its <strong>Drive</strong>, whether the vehicle provides power to just one set of wheels or to all of them; its <strong>Locomotion</strong>, what it sits on that makes it move.</p>\n<p><strong>        Drive:</strong></p>\n<p>        <em>Front-Wheel/Rear Wheel Drive: </em>Vehicles with front-wheel or rear-wheel drive apply the power to only one set of wheels. This makes them cheaper and easier to manufacture than the all-wheel drive, making it the standard for the industry.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>All-Wheel Drive:</em> Vehicles with all-wheel drive apply power to all of the wheels equally, giving them better launching and off-roading capabilities. These are often seen on trucks that frequently find themselves off the beaten path, as well as on the top-of-the-line racing Autos. They are almost never seen on steamhorses, though some of the extremely advanced experimental models may implement them.</p>\n<p>        All-wheel drive vehicles enjoy a +50 bonus to Torque, and reduce the base modifiers for difficult terrain by half.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <strong>Locomotion:</strong></p>\n<p><em>        Wheels: </em>Do these need an explanation?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Rail:</em> Despite being easily the most limiting method of locomotion for vehicles, rail has stuck around for centuries because it is simply the best at what it does. Rail is ideal for transporting a tremendous amount of cargo over great distances, especially if the terrain is relatively flat. The only problem is that you’re limited in where you can go to where rail lines have already been built, unless of course you intend to construct some yourself.</p>\n<p>        Rail provides very little friction, so it takes longer to stop for rail vehicles than it does for any other vehicle type. Regardless of the vehicle’s Stopping stat, rail vehicles have a Stopping maximum of 1. However, rail vehicles reduce their felt Load to 1/10th of its actual effect, allowing them to carry far more cargo than they typically could.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Pedrail: </em>Perhaps the strangest method of locomotion once is likely to see, pedrail served as the precursor to the far superior tracked vehicle. They consist of wheels with a series of feet connected to pivots, which allowed the feet to pivot and always stay flat against the surface they were climbing. This makes them excellent choices for inexpensive climbing solutions over difficult terrain and slopes of loose earth.</p>\n<p>        Vehicles outfitted with pedrail wheels reduce the base modifiers for difficult terrain by half, but their Top Speed has a permanent maximum of 1. They can always turn on their own axis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Prop:</em> The locomotion of choice (and, in fact, the only choice) for aerial vehicles, propeller-driven vehicles put their engines to work spinning a number of propellers or cyclorotors instead of wheels. This pushes air towards the back of the vehicle and propels it forward. For aerial vehicles, this air moves across the wings to create zones of differing air pressure and provide lift. For ground vehicles, they simply offer a way to provide thrust without having to deal with the mechanical challenge of putting the engine’s power to the wheels.</p>\n<p>        Vehicles outfitted with props can interact with the rules for headwinds, tailwinds, and crosswinds in the Vehicles on Difficult Terrain section above, though Ground vehicles don’t have to worry about stalling out. Aerial vehicles must use props, else they cannot maneuver in the air (and in most cases, can’t even become airborne in the first place). Props are also very loud compared to other forms of locomotion, granting anyone making a Perception check to hear them a +10 circumstance bonus to the check.</p>\n<p>        Incidentally, all aquatic vehicles are also propeller-driven, but aquatic vehicles don’t interact with the chassis component in the same way that aerial or ground vehicles do, and have their own propulsion and braking rules.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Tracks:</em> Made famous by the great war machines overseas, tracked vehicles can go just about anywhere. Instead of wheels, their engines turn a large drive sprocket that moves a large metal linked track that typically runs the length of its body on either side. These tracks provide a tremendous amount of traction, giving them sufficient grip no matter the terrain.</p>\n<p>        In order to run on tracks, a vehicle must have an All-Wheel Drive Chassis. Vehicles outfitted with tracks ignore all difficult terrain modifiers, but their Top Speed is permanently halved. However, they can move up to their Top Speed in reverse. Vehicles outfitted with tracks can always make zero-axis pivot turns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Screw:</em> These crazy contraptions are one of the rarer methods of locomotion, but they’re growing in popularity due to their utility. Rather than wheels or tracks, screw vehicles employ two massive pontoons that run the length of their body on either side. These pontoons have a wedge that spirals up the pontoons, like an enormous screw. These pontoons allow them to travel in ways that no other vehicle can.</p>\n<p>        In order to run on screws, a vehicle must have an All-Wheel Drive Chassis. Vehicles outfitted with screws ignore all difficult terrain modifiers, but their Top Speed has a permanent maximum of 1. However, they can move up to their Top Speed in reverse, as well as laterally from side to side. Additionally, their pontoons allow them to float, making them amphibious vehicles that can move with equal adeptness on both land and sea.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.myTQ0tax6948awYL"}},"_id":"IK7327TO436bD4EG"}

While most of the gear commonly found at trading posts and general stores will also be available in The Sundered Lands, there are some other items and equipment common to life in the wastes that may not be found elsewhere - chief among them are components and modifications to customize your ride.</p>\n<h3><strong>Components and Parts</strong></h3>\n<p>Buying, trading, bartering for, begging for, and otherwise acquiring vehicle components and parts is a daily affair in the lives of scavengers. These components are about the only reliable import into Bastion; those in the Upper Decks sponsoring a scavenger guild use their power and connections to guarantee these crucial items find their way into Bastion by way of supply airships. Keeping their scavengers happy is the most important thing to a sponsor or guild leader - scavengers can’t make them any money otherwise.</p>\n<p>The most ideal way to purchase components is to purchase them new. When possible, scavengers prefer to have brand new components flown in by airship or constructed on-site by the most skilled black thumbs available. This gets pricey, but new components will last longer and are easier to work on - nothing but the best will do for a guild’s MVPs. Used components are much more readily available and thus can be acquired easily and for less money, but obviously won’t last as long.</p>\n<p>The tables below all break down the base costs and modifiers to components based on a number of parameters. All prices below are given for components in the Auto classification and of the Ground type, with the Classification Modifiers table showing how to modify the component price for components in another vehicle classification and type. The exception to this rule is the Body components, for which prices are given for each classification and type specifically with no need for price modification.</p>\n<p>Swapping out or installing a component part requires a Craft skill check with a DC of 15 + the Component’s main stat. The install time for components is always two 8-hour days, with each day calling for the Craft skill check. Failure simply means the time is lost, but the installer can try again the following day without penalty and without losing any material.</p>\n<h3><strong>Component Base Costs and Descriptions</strong></h3>\n<p>This section will spell out the most basic costs of components of a given type for the component’s Horsepower, Power Transfer, Reactivity, or Brakes value as given on the table below. Most follow a pattern, which extends past the value given on the table for even higher-quality components (where applicable), though these components are exceedingly rare at the best of times, let alone in Bastion, and their purchase and availability should be treated with great care by a Game Master.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.5PRsKcEsizUcwGyz]{Body

elemental creature to bind to the engine, which has its own costs to acquire that are not included in this calculation. The buyer can choose to outsource such a task to another party, purchase one at market, or provide the elemental themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Buying an Assembled Vehicle</strong></h3>\n<p>For those unable to build a vehicle themselves using scavenged or purchased parts, the option may be available to purchase a fully assembled vehicle instead. In this case, the collective value of the vehicle components are treated as the raw materials. Thus, an assembled vehicle is always twice the collective value of the chosen components.</p>\n<p>This is true of any sort of labor being performed on a vehicle, as well. When paying for a black thumb to install a modification or swap out a component on a vehicle, its cost is always twice the value of that modification or component. If the purchaser provides the modification parts or components themselves, the labor value for the install is equal to the market value of that modification part or component.</p>\n<h3><strong>Modifications</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the many advantages of motorized vehicles over the living mounts of the past is their high degree of customizability. Just about every vehicle available has a huge list of possible modifications, add-ons, upgrades, and other alterations available to fine-tune it for the exact sort of work its pilot needs it to do. Because the list of available options is so exhaustive, it has its own dedicated page: @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.D2zl7PkUSmoJrSjm]{Vehicles - Modifications}.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fuel</strong></h3>\n<p>Odium is a hostile world where vehicles act as the lifeline for the struggling people trapped within. With these vehicles acting as the most important thing in the lives of those who depend on them...what, then, is more important? Their fuel, of course.</p>\n<p>With only a small handful of exceptions, all engines require fuel to operate properly. The costs for these fuels fluctuate constantly with dozens of factors playing into what determines their price. While perhaps not representing the prices of fuel at all times, the table below gives a good baseline for the Game Master to reference as the price for a fuel when supply and forecasts for availability are at their most ideal.</p>\n<table style=\"width:31.5186%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:100%\" colspan=\"2\">Fuel Costs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:44.7633%\">Fuel Type</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:55.2367%\">Cost per Unit</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:44.7633%\">Water</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:55.2367%\">1 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:44.7633%\">Deezil</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:55.2367%\">4 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:44.7633%\">Guzzolene</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:55.2367%\">6 cp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Each fuel has different properties, significance, and methods of handling. These are detailed below. One thing that is common across all fuel types, however, is that they are not potable - at the very least, they can make the imbiber sick, and in the worst cases, they act as deadly ingested poisons. It is best to treat all forms of fuel with extreme caution in every situation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Due to the toxic nature of some fuels, players may find themselves tempted to use fuels as a form of poison. While not impossible, these fuels require a good bit more than most poisons to be effective (an entire mouthful or more, compared to the few drops of other poisons), and most thinking creatures with any sense of self-preservation will immediately spit out the fuel due to its powerful, distinct flavor and tendency to burn soft tissues. Game Masters should be wary of allowing players to trick their foes into drinking sufficient quantities of these fuels without a tremendous amount of planning and effort. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>        Water:</em> Not all water can be suitable for drinking, and Bastion is not the type of city to waste anything if they can help it. Excess moisture from industrial applications gets boiled off, then recondensed to make water for situations that don't require potability, like washing down mud and silt in the mines, or as fuel for steam engines. Because it isn’t potable, it isn’t worth nearly as much as the stuff that’s safe to drink, making it the most cost-effective fuel source.</p>\n<p>        If consumed, the imbiber must make a DC 12 Fortitude save. Failure means they are nauseated for a 1 minute per point of failure, and that they have contracted <a title=\"Filth Fever\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases/diseases-paizo-inc/filth-fever/\">filth fever</a>. Characters are also subject to this saving throw if they get a suitable amount of fuel water in an open wound. This has been known to occur if a denizen of the Steamgrates happens to get a thorough dousing from a busted industrial pipe above or spends too much time in the downpour of the leaky pipes from the layers above. In these cases, it is referred to colloquially as “drizzle sickness.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Deezil: </em>This energy-dense fuel is brewed in enormous vats in Industria (unfortunate, for those that happen to live in the Steamgrates layer above them). Deezil is the by-product of huge churning vats that ends up as the final destination for all solid sewage in Bastion, as well as the city’s dead. The result is a stable, energy-dense fuel used for generators, machinery, and vehicles running deezil engines. Deezil is not considered to be very toxic, especially when compared to guzzolene, but still presents a serious danger if handled improperly.</p>\n<p>        If consumed, the imbiber must make a DC 14 Fortitude save. Failure means they are nauseated for 2 minutes per point of failure, and that they suffer the effects of deezil fuel as an ingested poison. Its onset is 10 minutes, has a frequency of once per minute for 5 minutes, is cured after 2 consecutive saves, and deals 1d3 Constitution damage. The fuel can also be vomited at any point prior to taking the initial damage, which immediately stops the victim from taking additional damage.</p>\n<p>        The fumes for deezil fuel can also pose a threat. If a character inhales the fumes directly, or spends too much time in an unventilated space with an open container of deezil, they must make a DC 14 Fortitude save. Failure means they suffer the effects of deezil fuel as an inhaled poison. Its onset is 1 minute, has a frequency of once per minute until the victim has left the area and can once again breathe clean air, and deals 1d3 points of Constitution and Intelligence damage as well as applying a @Compendium[pf1.spells.n0bsyxchnigkkuqo]{Confusion} effect as per the spell.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Guzzolene: </em>Whereas deezil is a stable fuel made from recycled waste, guzzolene is a volatile, toxic, flammable, all-around dangerous fuel made by applying a series of alchemical processes to oils pulled from the earth beneath Bastion. Some compare its handling and use to dealing with liquid fire. Despite how dangerous it is, the high-octane fuel is highly sought after for its powerful effects on engines strong enough to handle it.</p>\n<p>        If consumed, the imbiber must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Failure means they are nauseated for 5 minutes per point of failure, and that they suffer the effects of guzzolene as an ingested poison. Its onset is 10 minutes, has a frequency of once per minute for 5 minutes, is cured after 3 consecutive saves, and deals 1d6 Constitution damage. The fuel can also be vomited at any point prior to taking the initial damage, which immediately stops the victim from taking additional damage.</p>\n<p>        The fumes for guzzolene can also pose a threat. If a character inhales the fumes directly, or spends too much time in an unventilated space with an open container of guzzolene, they must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Failure means they suffer the effects of guzzolene as an inhaled poison. Its onset is 1 minute, has a frequency of once per minute until the victim has left the area and can once again breathe clean air, and deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage and 1d3 points of Intelligence drain as well as applying a @Compendium[pf1.spells.n0bsyxchnigkkuqo]{Confusion} effect as per the spell.</p>\n<p>        Guzzolene is also a volatile explosive compound, and can cause a tremendous amount of damage if improper handling leads to a sufficient amount catching fire. Guzzolene kept in sealed containers explodes for 1d10 fire and force damage, and affecting an area with a 5-ft radius spread, per 5 units. The explosion leaves behind a fire in that entire area, catching creatures and flammable materials on fire within it and setting creatures and flammable materials on fire upon entering it (unless they succeed on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw). Anything that has been set on fire takes 1d6 points of fire damage immediately, and again each round they fail their Reflex save until they finally succeed on the save and put themselves out. The fire burns itself out in about a minute.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Void: </em>This mysterious material at the heart of the enigmatic void engine is said to be a material so anathema to the natural world that it reacts with the very air itself. While a fuel unto itself, in many ways it behaves quite differently. It is unavailable for purchase anywhere, but that hasn’t proved to be a problem for owners of the few known void engines, as they are so efficient with their fuel that no one has ever so much as claimed to have seen one run out.</p>\n<p>        Because it is contained with numerous redundant safety measures inside the engine itself, the nature of the fuel is unclear. It is assumed to be a toxic compound, but if any have ever been exposed to it, they haven’t survived. Because of its reaction with material outside the engine itself, exposure would likely result in a catastrophic explosion before having to concern oneself with toxicity.</p>\n<p>        Void engines that detonate as a result of an attack against them explode for 1d12 points of force damage per unit of fuel the vehicle stores, in a radius around the vehicle equal to 10 feet per unit of fuel. This becomes the radius for an area of severe radiation centered on the vehicle.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Cq1yfTY5vefxa4lo"}}}

Lately, this has meant introducing parasite vehicles, quasi-vehicles that provide functionality to another vehicle as a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.LdfNkCeMnbYzUwaX]{Hardpoint} modification.</p>\n<p>Parasite vehicles are a broad and diverse category, but typically, they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cannot move under their own power</li>\n<li>Require pilots of their own (called \"operators\")</li>\n<li>Do not have Components of their own</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite being vehicles-within-vehicles, parasite vehicles are in many ways vehicles in their own right - they have a <strong>Size</strong>, <strong>Classification</strong>, <strong>Weight</strong>, and <strong>Cost </strong>just as normal vehicles do. They have parts that provide power for their functionality and can be disabled through hit point damage, provided by Armor according to their Classification. They replace the idea of crew capacity with their <strong>Operator</strong>, who activates the vehicle’s abilities and makes skill checks and saving throws on its behalf just as a pilot does.</p>\n<p>They can accept any vehicle modifications for which they can qualify - usually, those that do not require a particular Body style, Component, or mobility type. Being vehicles, they can also support Hardpoint mounts just as any other vehicle. If these Hardpoints are mounted with a siege weapon, the parasite vehicle’s operator is able to take up the firing position and combine the firing action with operation of the parasite vehicle.</p>\n<p>Because parasite vehicles do not have Components, they are incapable of using abilities or taking actions that require a Push to succeed, and are in turn immune to effects that are resisted by a Push.</p>\n<p>Because parasite vehicles are powered in part by their host vehicle, they do not have an Hours of Operation restriction, and do not deplete the Hours of Operation for their host vehicle. They can operate while their host vehicle is powered down, but are considered to be disabled and unusable whenever their host vehicle is.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"6\">Parasite Vehicles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Size</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Class</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Operators</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Cost</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Ball turret</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">800 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">850 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Excavator</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Heavy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">35,000 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2,200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Rotating turret</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Auto</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1+2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5,000 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Ball Turret:</strong> These small, cramped altazimuth-mount turrets are shaped like spheres, with the operator having to climb inside for operation. It is typically used as a gun turret for Aerial Heavies, and as a result, is uniquely designed to mount two Large siege weapons on its Large-sized Hardpoint that the operator can fire simultaneously. It can only do this if both Hardpoints hold a Large siege weapon - mounting any other Hardpoint modification on it means only being able to hold a single Large Hardpoint.</p>\n<p>The ball turret can be fully rotated along both axes in a single round, allowing it to rotate into position for any action the operator wants it to perform within the same round that it performs the desired action.</p>\n<p><strong>Excavator:</strong> This piece of heavy construction equipment is little more than a powered digger, wielding a 20-foot-long boom arm with a bucket already mounted on its available Hardpoint. Some scavengers will remove the excavator unit from its crawler chassis and mount it on a Heavy so they can use the boom arm on their rigs. With an excavator mounted on a Hardpoint, it can be used to help load and unload cargo, to allow vehicle crew to board another vehicle, or even right the vehicle if it capsizes.</p>\n<p>The arm itself confers three special attacks: a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-weapons.91aGsaLZRuGZoV6Z]{Batter}, performed by using the side of the bucket to bludgeon its target; a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-weapons.9m7Be4nCZKFfDWKI]{Scrape}, using the prongs of the bucket to pierce and tear its target; and a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-weapons.qnvTln04ozx0nEQs]{Spin}, where the excavator is rotated with the arm fully extended. The batter and scrape attacks deal 5d6 points of damage (bludgeoning for the batter attack, piercing and slashing for the scrape) with the Destructive weapon quality, and can be made against any target within 20 feet. The spin attack acts as a bull rush attack with a CMB of +15 against every creature or unattended object within 30 feet, pushing them in the direction of the spin.</p>\n<p>The excavator can make one full rotation in a single round, allowing it to rotate into position for any action the operator wants it to perform within the same round that it performs the desired action. Performing any action with the excavator requires the operator to make a full-round action.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotating Turret:</strong> These large assemblies are up-armored (base Armor of 30) housings for crew and armament, with their own engines and drive mechanism to spin the heavy turret. They are mostly seen on the latest tank designs, and typically mount a siege firearm of some sort, though they have their own Huge Hardpoint and are capable of mounting any compatible Hardpoint modification the owner wishes.</p>\n<p>The rotating turret can make one full rotation in a single round, allowing it to rotate into position for any action the operator wants it to perform within the same round that it performs the desired action. It can be operated by a single Operator, but can house up to 3 - usually the operator doubling as a gunner, a loader or other crew for the mounted siege firearm, and a radio operator or commander in typical tank crews.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.NRLpjer3sx9IRjMj"}},"_id":"LK2rVtw5v1qn3MHh"}
{"_id":"LdfNkCeMnbYzUwaX","name":"Vehicles - Hardpoints","content":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Hardpoints\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EPdMWRFoQcH9SgBecKxU4q6k523FThdzcZ7BVcg9mrM/edit?usp=sharing\">Hardpoints</a></strong></p>\n<p>While a lot of vehicle modifications address existing elements of the vehicle such as its Components (see the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.D2zl7PkUSmoJrSjm]{Modifications} rules for more info), some modifications add new features or even smaller vehicle-type platforms to the vehicle. These special modifications, called Hardpoint Modifications, are truly what make Odian black thumbs the most creative in the world - they allow the enterprising machinist to achieve a vehicle’s greatest potential for customizability and modularity.</p>\n<h2>What are Hardpoints?</h2>\n<p>Every vehicle has a capacity for making dramatic modifications to its Body and overall form to eke out brand new possibilities for utility. These<strong> Hardpoints</strong> represent the vehicle’s ability to support a considerable change to its shape and structure. The modifications themselves come in all shapes and sizes, so one could imagine that some are too large for a smaller vehicle to reliably support and still function properly. Hardpoint modifications themselves all have a <strong>Size</strong> attribute, which is meant to act as a representation of their physical bulk. These reflect the size categories that are already established for creature and vehicle sizes.</p>\n<h2>Bigger is Better</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, a vehicle has exactly one Hardpoint equal to its size. This means that any vehicle can mount exactly one Hardpoint modification of the same size as the vehicle itself. Attempting to mount any Hardpoint modification of a larger size category will simply fail - the vehicle does not have the infrastructure required to support this modification.</p>\n<p>If that were where it ended, Hardpoints would not be a very flexible system. In order to support additional options for mounting Hardpoint modifications to a vehicle’s available Hardpoints, any Hardpoint can be split into a pair of Hardpoints one size category lower.</p>\n<p>Say for example that a black thumb has a Gargantuan vehicle, with exactly one Gargantuan Hardpoint. They could mount a Gargantuan Hardpoint modification, and that would be it - their vehicle is supporting all they can by way of Hardpoint modifications. Alternatively, they could instead split that mount into two Huge-sized Hardpoint modifications. They could then mount a Huge Hardpoint modification in one Hardpoint, then split the second into two Large-sized Hardpoints, then maybe split each of those into two Medium-sized Hardpoint modifications, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Flex Mounting</h2>\n<p>To express the greatest amount of flexibility possible, the Hardpoints system does not have an opinion on the locations of mounts. The Game Master and Players are encouraged to consider what makes the most sense for where and how a Hardpoint modification is mounted. The Game Master and Players are also encouraged to consider the Rule of Cool when making these choices.</p>\n<h2>Hardpoint Modifications</h2>\n<p>A list of available Hardpoint modifications are available below. They have a number of attributes:</p>\n<p><em>Size</em>, the size category for the Hardpoint modification.</p>\n<p><em>Effect</em>, the combination of benefits and penalties the vehicle receives after installation is complete. This is expressed in the write-up for the modification, and does not appear in the table.</p>\n<p><em>Weight</em>, the weight added to the vehicle after the Hardpoint modification is installed.</p>\n<p><em>Install Difficulty</em>, the Craft DC to install the Hardpoint modification correctly.</p>\n<p><em>Install Time</em>, the amount of time it takes to install the Hardpoint modification correctly.</p>\n<p><em>Cost</em>, the price to purchase the parts to apply the Hardpoint modification. To have it installed by a technician, this cost is doubled.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:170px\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td

Creatures standing on a lancer’s perch are considered to automatically succeed on any saving throw to avoid falling off of or being thrown from a vehicle. They often will include a rack to hold thundersticks, but can also be used in combination with a mounted siege firearm Hardpoint for a safe gun platform, or even as a precarious place to hold a small amount of tied-down cargo.</p>\n<p><strong>Lookout Post:</strong> These semi-armored platforms are often found mounted on a trailer Hardpoint to allow a vehicle’s crew to watch the horizon for coming threats. It serves much the same purpose as a lancer’s perch for larger vehicles (and grants the same benefits), except for the added benefit of providing some armored cover - base Armor 10 - and conferring its benefits to as many as four Medium creatures instead of just one.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil Slick:</strong> This pressurized canister, typically mounted under the rear bumper, holds slick oil that it can spray out  - done as part of a piloting action by the vehicle’s pilot - to coat the ground behind it. It creates a patch of oil equal to the size of the vehicle (not including trailers). This oil acts like the @Compendium[pf1.spells.ik9u3eel5vfwrtb5]{Grease} spell, and any vehicle that passes over it must succeed on a Push against its Chassis or lose control. It can hold 4 uses - 1 unit of oil each - before having to be refilled.</p>\n<p><strong>Plow:</strong> This enormous metal wedge allows a vehicle to push obstacles out of its way - no matter what they are. As part of a vehicle piloting action, a Pilot can choose to raise or drop a plow. When a plow is dropped while the vehicle is on loose soil, sand, or snow, it creates a cloud of the substance all around its front. This turns mundane difficult terrain to normal terrain for the benefit of it and any vehicles or creatures behind it, and puts out any fires on and creates an effect like the @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud} spell over the entire front half of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>The plow also helps protect a vehicle during a front-on collision. When the vehicle strikes an obstacle at the front, roll 2d10 for a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-weapons.0bnvqXm5xKkm9cq5]{Plow (Auto)} and 5d10 for a @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-weapons.eMXxo64HBannM8Im]{Plow (Heavy)}. The vehicle with the Plow reduces this amount from the damage it suffers from the collision, while the opposing vehicle suffers this amount as damage.</p>\n<p>An Auto plow is size Medium, weighs 850 pounds, and costs 150 gp. A Heavy plow is size Large, weighs 8,000 pounds, and costs 350 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Polecat Mount:</strong> This well-known device is simply a large metal pole with a heavy counterbalance mounted on an A-frame. At the end of the pole, a crew member (called a “polecat”) can buckle themselves in to stay attached to the end of the pole. Once strapped in, another crew member at the base can shift the pole to either side along a single axis. With a 20-foot reach, the pole can be used to put the polecat in position to attack targets on other vehicles. From here, they can do whatever they wish - attack targets in range, grapple and drag targets off a platform or vehicle, or detached from the pole and board another vehicle. Buckling into a polecat mount is a swift action. Rotating it across its entire range of movement can be done as a move-equivalent action.</p>\n<p><strong>Siege Weapon:</strong> This mount will support a Siege Weapon or Siege Firearm of equivalent Size. It costs no more than the siege weapon being mounted, and weighs only what that siege firearm weighs. The Install DC is 12 for a Large siege weapon, +2 per increase in size category over Large. The Install Time is 1 day for a Large siege weapon, +1 day per increase in size category over Large.</p>\n<p><strong>Smoke Screen:</strong> These canisters hold and burn oil in order to create huge clouds of smoke behind them. As part of a piloting action, the vehicle’s pilot can activate the smoke screen, causing a massive gout of thick black smoke to erupt from behind the vehicle. This creates an identical effect to the @Compendium[pf1.spells.kjke96zd1j1jz48z]{Stinking Cloud} spell, forming a cloud as wide as the vehicle along its path of travel for 1 minute. It can hold 4 uses - 1 unit of oil each - before having to be refilled.</p>\n<p><strong>Steamhorse Boom:</strong> These specialized boom arms are designed to deploy steamhorses on a moment’s notice without stopping. The arms stick straight up when in a state of rest, holding a steamhorse on its side. The rider can climb atop such a mounted vehicle, then release the boom arm, as a move equivalent action. The arm then swings out and drops the steamhorse, allowing them to hit the ground in motion.

One such new development comes from the realm of alchemy, where vehicle-specific potions have entered the market. Now vehicles can benefit from short-notice esoteric effects without a caster in the same way that people can.</p>\n<p>A fuel additive is a magic liquid that produces its effects after mixing with the fuel and being drawn into the engine. Fuel additives are very similar to potions, and indeed can be thought of as potions for vehicles. A fuel additive can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of some spells or psionic powers of up to 3rd level that have a casting time of less than 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel Additives as Loot</strong></p>\n<table style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Minor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Major</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Caster Level</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">01-20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">--</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">--</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21-60</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">01-20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">--</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">61-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21-60</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">01-20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">--</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">61-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Fuel Additive Costs<br /></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Full Prepared</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Full Spontaneous</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3/4 Esoterics</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Half</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12 gp 5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12 gp 5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">12 gp 5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">25 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">150 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">200 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">200 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">375 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">450 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">525 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">525 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>Price of Fuel Additives</strong></h3>\n<p>The price of a fuel additive is equal to the level of the spell × the creator’s caster or manifester level × 25 gp. If the fuel additive has a material component cost, it is added to the base price and cost to create. Table: Fuel Additive Costs gives sample prices for fuel additives created at the lowest possible caster or manifesting level for each category of esoterics class. Note that some fuel additives appear at different levels for different esotericists. The level of such spells or powers depends on the brewer of the fuel additive.</p>\n<p>Fuel additives are like spells or powers affected upon a vehicle. The administrator of the fuel additive doesn’t get to make any decisions about the effect - the brewer of the fuel additive has already done so. The vehicle consuming the fuel additive is the effective target, but the effective caster is the vehicle’s pilot (though the fuel additive indicates the caster or manifester level, the pilot still controls the effect).</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A typical fuel additive consists of 16 ounces of liquid held in a glass or tin container with a long pour-spout and fitted with a tight stopper or screw-on lid. The container is usually about 10 inches high and 2 inches wide, and weighs 1 pound. The container has Armor Class 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12.</p>\n<p><strong>Activation:</strong> Applying a fuel additive to a vehicle is a two-part process. First, the fuel additive must be added to the fuel - poured into the vehicle’s fuel tank. Doing this is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The pilot can then choose to activate it at any point while the vehicle is in operation within the next hour, which takes another standard action from the pilot (which provokes an attack of opportunity). If the fuel additive is not used within an hour of being added to the fuel tank, it destabilizes and is wasted. Upon activation, the fuel additive takes effect immediately. The target of the effect is the vehicle itself, even if the spell or psionic power effect that the fuel additive is replicating would not ordinarily qualify it as a target.</p>\n<p><strong>Drinking Fuel Additives:</strong> Because they are intended to be added to vehicle fuel tanks, fuel additives are not formulated for consumption by creatures. Fuel additives are ingested poisons if consumed. The imbiber must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means they are nauseated for 1 minute per point of failure, and that they suffer the effects of fuel additives as an ingested poison. Its onset is 10 minutes, has a frequency of once per minute per 5 minutes, is cured after 2 consecutive saves, and deals 1d4 Constitution damage. The fuel additive can also be vomited at any point prior to taking the initial damage, which immediately stops the victim from taking additional damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel

{"_id":"UbpSzyiNU4U6Gs47","name":"Vehicles - Components","content":"<p>Vehicles are made of a number of parts, each of which have a number of statistics which define their operation and performance. While most parts are exclusive to a particular classification, some parts can actually be used on other classifications for interesting results.</p>\n<p>Each part will have its own statistics that define aspects of the vehicle’s final performance statistics, often in combination with one or more parts on the machine. The possibilities in combining parts to create specialized high-performance machines are nearly limitless - one may spend hours wrenching on their hog or stallion, tweaking the numbers until their prized rig is just right. Each vehicle classification has five major components, which will each have some statistics that are shared with other parts and some that are unique to that part. These five components are the Body, the Engine, the Transmission, the Chassis, and the Suspension.</p>\n<p>With the exception of the Body, all components will also have an<strong> Integrity.</strong> This describes the current reliability of that component, and how many more times it can break and be repaired before it can no longer be salvaged for anything other than scrap, and must be completely replaced.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Body:</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> The body of the vehicle describes its general shape and structure, as well as its type. There are a large number of body styles and shapes, and a driver can modify these down to the panels themselves to get the shapes they want. The body will typically define the following:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Style:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> The body style gives the basic shape, door arrangement, and crew capacity on a vehicle. A list of the most common body styles can be found later in this chapter, though custom styles not already defined can also be found or made.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Armor Class:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Like most objects, vehicles have an armor class. This is not necessarily dependent on the vehicle’s Body, but is considered an aspect of the Body component regardless. A vehicle’s AC is equal to 10 + its Size modifier + its Reactivity. In the case of vehicles, the Reactivity is treated as the vehicle’s Dexterity score, and any situation in which it would be denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class will see it denied its Reactivity as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Armor: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Some vehicle bodies are sturdier than others. This figure works in many ways like Hardness on other objects, and can be modified with armor upgrades or downgrades. Some body styles within a classification may have different base Armor values depending on their shape and what material was used to manufacture the Body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Hit Points: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">All sorts of dangers in the wastes can cause damage to a vehicle’s body. Attacks to a vehicle are assumed to strike the Body, and do not damage a particular component. When the vehicle’s Hit Points have reached zero, it’s too beat up to drive, and has to receive some general repairs. See the Vehicle Rules section for more information on attacking and damaging a vehicle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">       </em></span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Weight: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Each body comes with a base weight, given in pounds. This weight is usually meant to describe the vehicle’s fully-assembled operating weight, with a full tank of fuel, but no crew or cargo. It assumes an average weight for each required component, but some modifications may increase or decrease the weight based on which abnormal parts may be applied. Such weight modifications will be described in the part description.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Unlike the other four base components, the Body does not have Integrity, as there is nothing to necessarily wear down; most damage to these components comes from combat.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Engine: </em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Engine describes the power plant for the vehicle. Most engines in The Sundered Lands will operate by using expanding gas to drive pistons, either by rapidly converting water into steam or by igniting combustible materials. The vehicle engine is the most important component of a vehicle, providing all of the power needed to haul cargo or reach empyrean speeds. It will define the following:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Type: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This describes the method of operation of the engine. The overwhelming majority of engines in The Sundered Lands will be a steam engine, an internal combustion engine, or an arcanotech engine, though all manner of strange unique engines may exist in secret.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Horsepower (Ho): </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The power of engines is the all-important core of a vehicle that the entire Odian culture is built on. Whether a vehicle is meant to be light and fast, slow and strong, or somewhere in between, the engine must be as strong as is possible to achieve desired results. This stat will interact with the Transmission Power Transfer to determine the assembled vehicle’s Top Speed and Torque.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">       </em></span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">         </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Fuel: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">All engines run on something, and this defines what powers the engine. This could viably be nearly any sort of combustible material though, typically, gasses and fluids are far more common as a fuel than solid material. Common fuels might be water or steam, alcohol, alchemical compounds, or magical sources, though there is nearly no limit here and even more experimental sources of engine fuel may be found. This stat will define how many hours your vehicle will be able to operate before needing to refill the tank.</span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p>An easy way for Game Masters to think about or describe an Engine is to think of the Horsepower as the number of cylinders the Engine has, with odd numbers either representing a particularly powerful Engine with one fewer cylinder than the Horsepower, or a particularly weak or worn-out Engine with one more cylinder than the Horsepower. This may not be perfectly accurate to the real world, but serves as an excellent short hand for describing the look of an Engine to players.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"><br /></span><em>        </em><em>Transmission: </em>Even the most powerful engine is useless unless you have a way to apply its power. This is where the transmission comes in - it manipulates the power from the engine through increasing stepwise gear ratios to change the vehicle speed and torque. After the choice of engine, the transmission is the most important choice when building a vehicle. The choice of transmission will be influenced by whether you are building a massive tank of a War Rig or a lightning-quick stallion. It will define the following:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">       </em></span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Type: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">There are two main types of transmission. The most common by a huge margin is the manual transmission, where the driver must change the gear themselves at key moments using a lever that mechanically moves gears around directly. Distantly second is the automatic transmission, so named because the gears are changed automatically using a complex series of clockwork gears. Just as with other components, other rarer types of transmission may exist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">       </em></span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Power Transfer (Po):</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Whatever you are looking for in a Power Transfer stat will determine whether you are going for speed or strength. A higher Power Transfer means the transmission is better able to get heavier loads moving, but less able to apply the engine’s power to the overall top speed. This stat will interact with the Engine Horsepower to determine the assembled vehicle’s Top Speed and Torque.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Chassis: </em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">More than just a single part, the Chassis is what all other components rest on to make a complete vehicle. It’s what supports the Body, cradles the Engine, and is connected to the wheels by way of the Suspension, along with all of the parts outside of the Engine and the Transmission that play a part in delivering the Engine’s power to the wheels. The combinations of options in a vehicle’s Chassis are nearly limitless, allowing for unparalleled customizability. This component is a big part of what makes a scavenger’s ride uniquely their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Type: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The type of Chassis will define a number of characteristics about the vehicle, including but not limited to which wheels drive the vehicle (rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, etc.), how many wheels the vehicle has, and the type of locomotion system it uses (wheel, tracks, screw-propelled, etc.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Brakes (Br): </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Almost as important as a vehicle’s ability to move is its ability to stop, preferably as quickly and reliably as possible. The Brakes can sometimes be easy to overlook, but any halfway intelligent scavenger will ensure their black thumb is keeping their Brakes in peak condition - the fun of going fast quickly ends when you need to stop, and the brake pedal does nothing. This stat will interact with the vehicle’s Load to determine the assembled vehicle’s Stopping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It is important to note that Aquatic vehicles do not have a Chassis.</span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Suspension: </em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The suspension system is what permits the wheels to move independently of the rest of the vehicle, allowing the wheels to react to inconsistencies in the road surface without the occupants feeling each and every bump and dip. Good suspensions permit drivers to take corners tighter, hit larger obstacles without sustaining serious damage, and even perform extreme stunts such as jumps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Type: </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">There are countless different types of suspension, with more being developed constantly. Typically, the vehicle’s suspension will fall into two major categories: dependent suspension (two or more wheels move together), or independent suspension (each wheel moves on its own). Within these two categories are many different styles of suspension, which may be driven mechanically (coil or leaf springs), pneumatically, hydraulically, with a combination hydropneumatic system, or other more esoteric systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Reactivity (Re): </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">How quickly your vehicle responds when you turn the wheel can mean life or death in a lot of situations. Unless you’re planning on just going fast in a straight line, a scavenger should invest as much as they can in making sure their ride can turn as sharply as possible...without tumbling end-over-end, of course. This stat interacts with the vehicle’s Top Speed and Load to determine the assembled vehicle’s Turning.</span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"white-space:pre\"><em style=\"white-space:normal\">        </em></span><em>Modifications:</em> Whenever a scavenger looks to kit out their machine with custom components or unique features, they are applying a Modification to it. Modifications are a wide category covering anything that isn’t one of the primary five Components. This could include things like mounted weapons, defensive systems, trailers and sidecars, alternative methods of propulsion, pedal extensions, and who knows what else? Modifications will typically have a more freeform approach to stats and how they impact the vehicle’s overall build, but most will have a Weight stat which counts toward the vehicle’s curb weight, and thus its Load.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.UO0O6gnBPeOCWLyx"}}}

The abstraction used by Pathinder to represent overall health and wellness cannot allow for lasting wounds. This system aims to provide that by giving rules to suffer catastrophic damage from wounds that would realistically maim or kill. The results of these rules could leave a Player Character permanently hobbled, but if the Game Master and Players agree that permanent disability is too much, they may also implement the rules for @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.gCRcLkpk3SQQwnd9]{Body Swaps} in order to give themselves back their missing limbs.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Causes Special Damage?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are two situations that can cause a character to suffer from special damage.</p>\n<p>The first is if a character takes more than 50% of their total Hit Points in damage from a single attack.</p>\n<p>The second is if a character suffers from a confirmed critical hit that causes their current Hit Points to drop to 0 or below.</p>\n<p>The third is somewhat more nebulous: the Game Master may rule that certain spells or effects that main or cause damage via transmutation may subject their victims to special damage.</p>\n<h3><strong>Using Special Damage</strong></h3>\n<p>When a creature is subject to special damage, roll on the table below.

This modification allows Small-sized creatures to pilot vehicles designed for Medium-sized creatures without issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Control Locks:</strong> Sometimes the pilot has to get involved in the fray, which leaves the vehicle’s controls unattended. With this modification, the pilot can, as a swift action, set a number of small mechanical devices into position. This locks the vehicle’s controls in place, essentially allowing the vehicle to maintain its current course and speed without having to be supervised by the pilot. While control locks are engaged, the vehicle itself manages its piloting checks, freeing up the pilot to do whatever they wish, even leave the pilot’s seat or the vehicle entirely. A control-locked vehicle can take only one action - continue moving at its current speed in the direction it is currently traveling. It cannot make Pushes or special pilot maneuvers on its own, nor can it use its pilot’s stats to defend against attacks. It is considered unattended for all purposes. The control locks can be disabled with another swift action once a pilot (not necessarily the original pilot) retakes control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong>Dual Engine:</strong> The most obsessive black thumbs may install a second engine onto the crankshaft in their vehicle, which can provide an enormous boost to a vehicle’s power in exchange for consuming more fuel. Any Steamhorse or Auto can be installed with a second engine suitable for its classification. Once complete, this increases the vehicle’s effective Horsepower by 50% of the weaker engine’s Horsepower, rounded down. The vehicle consumes double the amount of fuel, meaning for each Hour of Operation, it reduces its Hours of Operation by 2 instead of 1. Whenever the vehicle is required to Push its Engine, it must Push each of its engines. The cost listed for the modification is the cost to modify the vehicle’s crankshaft to accept a second engine - the second engine itself must also be acquired separately.</p>\n<p>Heavies have a special relationship with the Dual Engine modification. Because their engines are so large, they cannot use the Dual Engine modification without also having the Engine Swap (Auto → Heavy) modification.</p>\n<p><strong>Emergency Sails:</strong> Engines die all the time in the wastes, but the wind is often strong in Odium. Wise scavengers keep a set of these large cloth sails on hand as preparation for the worst. Unlike other modifications, this is not installed by default. Instead, the listed install time is used to determine how long it takes to install when necessary - typically when the engine is dead. This allows the vehicle to travel at a flat Speed value based on the current wind speed, per the table below. A vehicle using emergency sails always has an XLR8 of 1.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Wind Strength</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Wind Speed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Emergency Sail Speed</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Light</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0-10 mph</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Moderate</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">11-20 mph</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Strong</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">21-30 mph</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Severe</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">31-50 mph</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Windstorm</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">50+ mph</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4, +1 per additional 25 mph</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Extradimensional Cargo:</strong> It wouldn’t be wrong to call this a “trunk of holding,” because that is effectively why this modification was developed. This modification can take any vehicle cargo space of up to 12 cubic feet and increase its space to 150 cubic feet. The vehicle is still affected by the weight of all its cargo - it can simply carry more.</p>\n<p>If living creatures are placed within the cargo space, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from an extradimensional cargo hold is a full-round action. Items placed inside the cargo space do not offer any benefit to the vehicle hauling them. In an area that nullifies esoterics, the cargo hold loses its connection to the extradimensional space where its cargo is stored. This connection returns once it has been removed from the area of esoterics nullification.</p>\n<p>Installing an extradimensional cargo space is identical in practice to crafting a bag of holding, and as such, requires the same checks and crafting time as crafting a bag of holding type I.</p>\n<p><strong>Five-Point Harness:</strong> For the safety-conscious, these harnesses offer far more protection during a wreck than normal safety harnesses. For anyone buckled in with this harness, they reduce the damage taken in a wreck by an additional 50% over a normal safety harness, making a total reduction of 75%. The listed details on the table are per-seat, with only the seats receiving this modification gaining the benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel Additive Interface:</strong> This modification installs a pipe that leads directly to the fuel line, allowing fuel additives to be injected directly into the engine. With this modification, fuel additives can be added and activated all in the same standard action.</p>\n<p><strong>Killswitch:</strong> For the highly paranoid, kill switches are a proven way to ensure that your vehicle stays where you left it. These are essentially a series of buttons and switches installed on and around the dashboard of your vehicle, which must be pressed or flipped in a particular sequence programmed by the installer. Without the correct sequence being put in, the vehicle won’t start. An attempt to hot-wire the vehicle can be made, but the DC for the @Compendium[pf1.skills.CCy1fajKKU3K02iQ]{Disable Device} skill check to do so is doubled.</p>\n<p><strong>Radio:</strong> This small device picks up radio signals and plays them aloud over speakers. More advanced models can transmit audio from a receiver as well, making them vital for those looking to communicate while on the move.</p>\n<p><em>Standard</em>: This type of radio can receive air signals and play them, usually for news, information, or entertainment purposes. These are identical to the radio adventuring gear item, but are powered by the vehicle and thus do not require batteries.</p>\n<p><em>WB</em>: A WB, or “waste-band” radio, is used by cargo haulers, aircraft, and other vehicle pilots to communicate with each other as well as stationary outposts. Since these transmit from inside a vehicle, they don’t have the power to send a signal over large distances. Their transmission distance is typically limited to about 5 miles. They otherwise function as a standard radio.</p>\n<p><strong>Shiny:</strong> This modification covers the surface of the vehicle in chrome, which is then buffed to a mirror finish. This makes it difficult to look at directly during the day due to the light reflecting off of it. During daylight hours, anyone trying to spot the vehicle gains a +10 bonus to their @Compendium[pf1.skills.YYmmxDgp0g3ltSUG]{Perception} check, but the vehicle and its occupants benefit from a 10% miss chance applied to attacks made against it, and a +5 bonus to Reflex saves against area of effect attacks.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.nucEucmd5gIJ4BrZ"}}}

{"_id":"cpuj7DT4RorGP2Fg","name":"Mutation","content":"<p>Prolonged exposure to radiation can result in mutations. Much like the dreaded wild magic surge, these alterations to the mind, body, and even sometimes spirit are unpredictable, and can be either a great boon or a terrible curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Rad Counter: </strong>Radiation that has stuck to a character is measured in what the Odians call \"rads.\" All characters who venture out into the wastes have a rad counter, which begins at 0 and has a threshold equal to the character's Constitution score. When a character's rad count reaches the threshold, they develop a random mutation - or, more accurately, the mutation they've been developing as a result of prolonged radiation exposure noticably manifests itself for the character. The exact nature of the mutation is rolled in secret by the Game Master, and passed to the character at the time that they discover it. This takes place over a period of [[1d6]] days from the moment the character's rad count reached its threshold.</p>\n<p><strong>Accumulating Rads: </strong>Whenever a character fails a Fortitude save to resist the effects of radiation poisoning, they gain a number of rads based on the severity of the radiation poisoning per the table below.</p>\n<p><strong>Removing Rads: </strong>Because rads represent the effects that radiation has on the stability of bodily cells, it is no easy feat to remove them. Typically spells of the conjuration (healing) school won't work, nor will any Heal skill check. The <em>restoration</em> line of spells is the only thing that can remove rads from a creature; treat the rad count as points of permanent ability score drain for the purpose of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Overexposure: </strong>Exposure to radiation continues to increment the rad counter even after it has reached its threshold. If a character manages to accumulate a number of rads equal to twice their threshold, they gain another mutation.

This is where a crew cab comes in. These larger pickups have an extra row of seating, increasing their Crew Capacity by +3. They also add an extra pair of doors - one for each side of the new row of seating.</p>\n<p><strong>Engine Swap:</strong> Whether due to availability concerns or simply the spirit of experimentation, occasionally black thumbs will perform an engine swap - putting an engine from one class of vehicle into the bay of another class of vehicle. The cost listed for the modification is the cost to modify the vehicle’s engine bay to accept the foreign engine - the engine itself must also be acquired separately.</p>\n<p><em>Auto → Heavy</em>: Usually caused by availability issues, Auto engines can be swapped into Heavy frames, though never on their own. In order to make a Heavy operate with an Auto engine, it requires two Auto engines, making the Dual Engines modification a prerequisite. Once installed, both Auto engines suffer a -2 Horsepower penalty for having to punch above their weight class. Even still, the combination of the two engines can potentially result in more power output than a single Heavy engine could.</p>\n<p><em>Auto → Steamhorse</em>: For the most insane speed freaks, a powerful V8 can be shoehorned into a Steamhorse frame for the ultimate in ill-advised power boosts. Auto engines installed in a Steamhorse frame gain an effective +2 Horsepower boost due to the huge reduction in weight they’re normally accustomed to hauling.</p>\n<p><strong>Expanded Fuel Tank:</strong> Fuel is essential for surviving the wastes. This makes the expanded fuel tank one of the most important modifications that a scavenger can invest in. This modification increases the size of the fuel tank, allowing it to hold more fuel. The vehicle’s fuel capacity and hours of operation are increased by 25% (rounded down). The vehicle’s weight and cost increase, as well as the modification install DC and time, are determined by their classification. This modification replaces and is replaced by the Extra Fuel Tank.</p>\n<p><em>Steamhorse</em>: The weight increases by 10 lbs. The install DC is 12. The install time is 2 hours. This modification costs 10 gp.</p>\n<p><em>Auto</em>: The weight increases by 30 lbs. The install DC is 15. The install time is 1 day. This modification costs 25 gp.</p>\n<p><em>Heavy</em>: The weight increases by 500 lbs. The install DC is 18. The install time is 5 days. This modification costs 75 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Extended Bed:</strong> The most efficient scavengers want to drag in as big a haul as possible. A natural choice then is to extend the bed of their utes. An extended bed pickup extends their pickup bed by an additional 2 feet, increasing the cubic feet of storage space it can hold by 24 cubic feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Fuel Tank:</strong> For the biggest increase in fuel capacity, the only choice is to sacrifice crew space. This modification removes one row of seats in the crew capacity (or the sleeper berth in the case of the Sleeper Cab Rig) and replaces it with a complete second fuel tank. This increases the fuel capacity for the vehicle by +100%. The vehicle’s weight and cost increase, as well as the modification install DC and time, are determined by their classification. This modification replaces and is replaced by the Expanded Fuel Tank.</p>\n<p><em>Steamhorse</em>: The weight increases by 40 lbs. The install DC is 15. The install time is 4 hours. This modification costs 25 gp.</p>\n<p><em>Auto</em>: The weight increases by 120 lbs. The install DC is 20. The install time is 2 days. This modification costs 75 gp.</p>\n<p><em>Heavy</em>: The weight increases by 2,000 lbs. The install DC is 25. The install time is 10 days. This modification costs 200 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Seating:</strong> The largest and most expensive phaetons are often used as limousines for wealthy passengers, and so can be upgraded to extend their seating arrangement. Each time this modification is purchased, it adds an extra row of seating to the phaeton body, increasings its Crew by +3. It also adds an extra 1,000 lbs of weight, and an extra pair of doors - one for each side of the new row. This modification can be purchased twice, to a total Crew of 3+3+3 and a maximum of 6 doors.</p>\n<p><strong>Hitch:</strong> This device is attached to the Chassis of a vehicle (or its Body directly, in the case of an Aquatic vehicle) to facilitate towing. Fitting a vehicle with a Hitch allows it to pull trailers. Day Cab Rig and Sleeper Cab Rig body styles come with hitches built-in.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster Chassis:</strong> Bigger is always better. If you agree, you should modify your vehicle with a Monster Chassis. This large, scaffolded frame for a Ground Auto increases its size by lifting the entire body up several feet. Vehicles modified in this way are elevated to the Heavy classification. They must now use Heavy components, and gain all the advantages and disadvantages of that vehicle class.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Road Tires:</strong> Racing slicks and everyday all-purpose tires can’t provide the grip one needs to properly move on difficult terrain. Instead scavengers turn to off-road tires, which have large paddles and deep treads to increase surface area and maximize grip on uneven or pliable surfaces. A vehicle outfitted with this modification is treated as being on pavement or stone while on hard or packed earth, and as being on hard or packed earth while on soft or loose earth. It also halves all penalties for road conditions, and the vehicle does not suffer from -1 effective Integrity when making Push attempts on unstable terrain. It instead suffers from -1 effective Integrity when making Push attempts on paved road or stone ground types.</p>\n<p>This modification is incompatible with the Solid Tires modification.</p>\n<p><strong>Reinforced Frame:</strong> This modification is ideal for pilots that find themselves frequently in vehicular combat, solidifying the vehicle’s frame in order to withstand more hits in combat. Vehicles with the reinforced frame modification are counted as one size category higher when figuring how much damage it receives from a collision. The vehicle’s weight increases by 20% when modified in this way, and the cost for this modification is 1 sp per pound increased. It takes 4 hours per the vehicle’s classification tier to complete this modification install - this equates to 4 hours for a Steamhorse, 8 hours for an Auto, 12 hours for a Heavy, and 16 hours for an Ultra.</p>\n<p><strong>Roll Cage:</strong> Wrecks are common in the wastes, and there is little more devastating to a (surviving) vehicle pilot than having their precious rig totaled in a wreck. To help protect against this, vehicles can be modified with a more rigid supporting structure to help keep them in a smaller number of pieces when they inevitably do wreck. Vehicles modified with a roll cage reduce any damage they take from a wreck by 50%. The vehicle’s weight increases by 15% when modified in this way, and the cost for this modification is 1 sp per pound increased. It takes 4 hours per the vehicle’s classification tier to complete this modification install - this equates to 4 hours for a Steamhorse, 8 hours for an Auto, 12 hours for a Heavy, and 16 hours for an Ultra.</p>\n<p><strong>Seaplane:</strong> Sometimes, an air vehicle needs to be able to land on a runway of water as opposed to earth. This modification replaces the standard air vehicle landing gear with large pontoons, allowing the plane to float on the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidecar:</strong> Steamhorse pilots are often left wanting when comparing their vehicle loadout to that of a sprinter like phaetons or coupés. The sidecar seeks to remedy that, serving as a way to add another fully disconnected passenger from the humble steamhorse. After installation, the sidecar changes the steamhorse to a 2+1 vehicle (as opposed to the default 1+1), allowing it to operate as a light attack vehicle or sprinter.</p>\n<p><strong>Ski Plane:</strong> For landings in remote locations, sometimes wheels are not the ideal landing gear. This modification replaces the standard air vehicle landing gear with large skis, which allows the plane to land on soft, loose earth like sand or snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Snorkel Intake:</strong> These modifications are essential when a vehicle absolutely must be forded across a river. Typically, a vehicle’s air intake is at the same level as its engine, and thus is very easy to flood in deep enough water. A snorkel intake raises the air intake, placing it as much as several feet above its stock location. A vehicle outfitted with a snorkel is only considered to be taking water into its air intake when the vehicle is fully submerged.</p>\n<p><strong>Tonneau Cover:</strong> Pilots who fear that their cargo will be stolen from their open-top pickup beds, fear no more. This modification is a hard shell that can be fastened to an Open Top cargo space, making it a Hard Top cargo space instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Weight Reduction:</strong> The easiest way to make a vehicle quicker and more agile is to strip out unnecessary weight, and luckily for the average black thumb, this modification is entirely free - after all, it costs nothing to get rid of stuff you already have. This modification can address stripping out two elements - Armor and Crew Capacity. For each point of Armor reduced, the vehicle loses 5% of its total weight. For each Crew Capacity removed, the vehicle loses 2% of its total weight. It takes 1 day per point of Armor reduced to complete the Armor weight reduction modification, and 1 hour per Crew Capacity removed to complete the Crew Capacity weight reduction modification. This can reduce the vehicle’s Armor to +0, and the Crew Capacity to 1 - only the pilot.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.bPHK7BesR5YAzHE7"}}}
{"_id":"dJuCCgo3ZYqIuCSa","name":"Vehicles - Building a Vehicle","content":"<p>Once all of the necessary components and desired modifications have been gathered and applied, the vehicle can be assembled. A complete vehicle has a different set of stats than its individual components, which are all influenced and modified by the stats of the component parts. The vehicle stats can be thought of as the vehicle’s “ability score modifiers” in that, much like ability score modifiers for a player character, these stats are informed by another set of stats, and are mostly what will be applied for practical vehicle usage.</p>\n<h3><strong>Component Stats</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to assemble a functioning vehicle, the user or builder must have gathered an Engine, a Transmission, a Chassis, a Suspension, and a Body. The values on the Engine’s <strong>Horsepower (Ho)</strong>, Transmission’s <strong>Power Transfer (Po)</strong>, Chassis’s <strong>Brakes (Br)</strong>, and Suspension’s <strong>Reactivity (Re)</strong> must fall within the usable range for each of these components, and each must have an <strong>Integrity </strong>greater than 0.</p>\n<p>The usable range for each component is typically between 1 and 10, though most parts can theoretically exceed 10 with enough modifications or with rare components. The exception to this is the Transmission’s <strong>Power Transfer</strong>, which will always be on a scale of 1 to 10. This is because the final vehicle stats that use Power Transfer in their calculations are measuring the percentage of the vehicle’s muscle being applied to either moving weight or to the vehicle’s top speed, so this statistic is representing what percentage is dedicated to each.*</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p>* For this reason, modifications to the Transmission will never modify the Power Transfer stat, but will likely modify the final assembled vehicle stat of Torque instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vehicle component <strong>Integrity </strong>will always be on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 representing a brand new component.</p>\n<h3><strong>Assembled Stats</strong></h3>\n<p>Once the vehicle has been assembled by a capable black thumb, the base component stats come together in various ways to form <strong>Top Speed (Sp)</strong>, <strong>Torque (Tq)</strong>, <strong>XLR8</strong>, <strong>Load (Ld)</strong>, <strong>Turning (Tu)</strong>, and <strong>Stopping (St)</strong>. These stats have an assortment of calculations, all of which are easy to perform with a calculator. The formulas for each of the assembled stats are detailed below.</p>\n<p><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">         </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Top Speed (Sp)</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">: This statistic is a representation of the vehicle’s maximum top speed. It is calculated by subtracting the Transmission’s Power Transfer from 11, then multiplying the difference by the Engine’s Horsepower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Torque (Tq):</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> This statistic is a representation of the vehicle’s maximum capacity for weight. It is calculated by multiplying the Engine’s Horsepower by the Transmission’s Power Transfer, then multiplying that number by 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Load (Ld):</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> This statistic is a representation of the vehicle’s overall Weight, translated in a way to more easily work with the other scaled stats. For every 200 pounds of Weight, the vehicle gains 1 point of Load. Additionally, the vehicle’s Load will impact its Top Speed and Hours of Operation. For every 100 points in the vehicle’s Load, the vehicle’s Top Speed and Hours of Operation are reduced by 1 (more on this in the Fuel and Operating Time section, below).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">XLR8:</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> This statistic is a representation of the vehicle’s ability to quickly move its own weight. The XLR8 represents the maximum Speed increase a vehicle can affect upon itself during a single move action. The pilot may choose to XLR8, and thus increase the vehicle’s Speed, anywhere from 1 up to its XLR8 (without exceeding their Top Speed). The XLR8 is calculated by dividing the vehicle’s Torque by its Load (to a maximum of the vehicle’s Top Speed).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Turning (Tu):</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> This statistic is a representation of the vehicle’s turning radius. The Turning is the minimum number of squares required to safely make a 90-degree turn while traveling at its current Speed, along both axes. For example, a vehicle traveling north with a Turning of 15 would have to travel 15 squares (75 feet) along the X-axis, then another 15 squares (75 feet) along the Y-axis in order to make a turn. The Turning is calculated by adding together the Speed and Load, then dividing that sum by the Reactivity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">        </em><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Stopping (St):</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> This statistic is a representation of the vehicle’s ability to safely bring itself to a stop. It is something like an inverse of XLR8 - the pilot may choose to decrease the vehicle’s current Speed by any number between 1 and its Stopping, until the vehicle has reached Speed 0 and stopped completely. The Stopping Distance is calculated by dividing the vehicle’s Load by 100, then subtracting the result from double the vehicle’s Brakes (to a minimum of 1).</span></p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, Aquatic vehicles have no Chassis, and therefore have no Brakes. Instead of relying on brakes to slow down, aquatic vehicles instead run their engines in reverse. This makes their Stopping equal to their XLR8.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A vehicle sheet for FoundryVTT that does all of the necessary calculations is provided in order to make applying changes to a vehicle quick and easy to do, even with temporary changes to modifiers on the fly for any circumstances. This sheet can be found <a title=\"TSL Module for Foundry\" href=\"https://github.com/AugmenTab/tsl-module\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ground, Aquatic, and Aerial Differences</strong></h3>\n<p>All the rules given above are for Ground vehicles. They have no additional stat considerations based on their type alone.</p>\n<p>Aerial vehicles function mostly the same as Ground vehicles in regards to components and final stats, with one key difference: Aerial vehicles will additionally have a minimum Speed value, which represents the Speed they must reach in order to achieve lift and become airborne. If at any point their Speed is reduced below this point, they begin to fall (though most Aerial vehicles can glide safely back to the ground so long as their wings are undamaged). If the vehicle is unable to reach this minimum Speed, then it is simply unable to fly.</p>\n<p>Aquatic vehicles are a little different, however, in that they are missing one key component: the Chassis. That’s right: Aquatic vehicles do not use a Chassis component at all! So then how do they stop? By running their engines in reverse, of course. All Aquatic vehicles treat their XLR8 as their Stopping stat, too, and slow down at exactly the same rate as they speed up.</p>\n<h3><strong>Actual vs Reference</strong></h3>\n<p>Among these statistics for a completed vehicle, there are three that refer directly to existing game measurements of distance and time: Turning, Stopping, and XLR8. These can be used to refer to a vehicle’s performance in the game without issue, and will be the most commonly necessary stats to use in-game. The remaining statistics (Speed, Torque, and Load), do not have an immediate connection to any existing game measurements. Load can be easily multiplied by 200 to give a rough estimation of the Weight, but the vehicle sheet also keeps track of the vehicle’s weight in the event that it is needed (just the total weight of whatever crew and cargo is being carried, plus the vehicle weight, makes for the total weight). Speed and Torque are meant to be used mostly for loose reference, so the players and the Game Master can see at a glance how much faster one vehicle is moving compared to another, or how much more muscle one has compared to another.</p>\n<p>A vehicle’s Top Speed is converted automatically to miles per hour, kilometers per hour, and squares per round on the vehicle sheet, which is a great reference when determining travel time over long distances. This is the most likely circumstance in which this information will be sought after, and is readily available as a result. Rarely should it be important to know anything other than the Top Speed in terms of squares per round or miles per hour during a combat situation, as raiding or other vehicle combat will almost always be taking place at the slowest vehicle’s current Speed. Even damage based on vehicle collisions is based on the Speed value, but some Game Masters may prefer to use their own damage calculations based on miles per hour instead. There are calculations for these in order to understand them should the need arise.</p>\n<p>To calculate the equivalent miles per hour for any given Speed, double the Speed value, then add 40.</p>\n<p>To calculate the equivalent squares per round, multiply the miles per hour by 88, then divide by 30.</p>\n<p>The vehicle sheet does provide this information for both the vehicle’s current Speed as well as a handy macro for converting any recognized speed unit value into any other, and post it to chat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fuel and Operating Time</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the base statistics, an assembled vehicle will also have values related to its fuel capacity and how long it can be driven before needing a refill. As a general rule, all vehicles of the same classification will have the same <strong>Fuel Capacity</strong>, which is how many Units of fuel they can hold in their tank or reservoir. Some modifications can increase or decrease this amount, and some special vehicles may naturally have an abnormal Fuel Capacity, but these will be fringe cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Units</strong> of fuel is a helpful way of determining the cost to refill a vehicle’s tank or reservoir. Not all vehicles use the same type of fuel, so instead of trying to include every possible measurement for all possible fuel types, fuel is instead defined as a fraction of a “whole” tank, with every topped off vehicle providing the same Hours of Operation as any other in its classification. The cost of fuel can fluctuate based on a number of factors, so prices are provided in this manual and by the Game Master on a per unit basis. Fuel is purchased in units, allowing a scavenger to purchase fractions of or complete tanks and reservoirs of all sizes.</p>\n<p>Related to the Fuel Capacity, a vehicle’s <strong>Hours of Operation</strong> is how long in hours the vehicle can be continually operated (while driven, idling, or otherwise powered on and consuming fuel) before the tank or reservoir is empty and must be refilled. This, too, will be about the same for every vehicle of the same classification, though as with the Fuel Capacity, modifications and special vehicles may provide abnormal figures. This is given for a full tank or reservoir, but determining the remaining Hours of Operation remaining on partial tanks is relatively easy math.</p>\n<p>Tanks or reservoirs are filled at a rate of 1 unit per round. This may require direct action from the character, in which case it requires their move-equivalent action, and cannot take any other actions that would require them to use their hands (or whatever limbs they are using to hold the fuel can they are refilling the vehicle with) or to move away from the vehicle. Some refilling aparati, such as automated pumps, need only be set up with an initial move-equivalent action, then continue filling unassisted until the vehicle is full or the source of fuel runs out.</p>\n<p>Below is a table showing the base Fuel Capacity and Hours of Operation for each classification:</p>\n<table style=\"width:56.7335%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:29.484%;text-align:center\">Classification</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.2383%;text-align:center\">Fuel Capacity</td>\n<td style=\"width:41.2776%;text-align:center\">Hours of Operation</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:29.484%;text-align:center\">Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.2383%;text-align:center\">4 units</td>\n<td style=\"width:41.2776%;text-align:center\">4 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:29.484%;text-align:center\">Auto</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.2383%;text-align:center\">12 units</td>\n<td style=\"width:41.2776%;text-align:center\">8 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:29.484%;text-align:center\">Heavy</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.2383%;text-align:center\">200 units</td>\n<td style=\"width:41.2776%;text-align:center\">24 hours</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Ultra classification mostly comprises specialty vehicles and custom builds, so the Fuel Capacity and Hours of Operation vary too drastically in this classification to simplify it here. Each vehicle will be a unique case, and will provide these values in their entry.</p>\n<p>Aerial vehicles require much more fuel to maintain their lift, and as such, have much larger fuel tanks to fill in order to get the same hours of operation out of their vehicle. An Aerial vehicle’s fuel capacity is eight times that of an equivalent Ground vehicle.</p>\n<p>Besides the base figure and modifiers from modifications or special vehicles, Hours of Operation is modified by one other value: the Load. Carrying or dragging a lot of weight is hard on an engine, and will increase the amount of fuel needed to go the same distance or travel the same speed as an engine not so inundated. For every 100 points of Load, there is a -1 penalty to the Hours of Operation. This is typically only a concern for vehicles in the Heavy or Ultra category, which are designed primarily for moving extremely heavy payloads, but it would not be impossible for other classifications to experience this penalty under the right circumstances.</p>\n<h3><strong>Armor and Hit Points</strong></h3>\n<p>Vehicles will have a base Armor value determined by their size, per the table below. Armor functions like Hardness in nearly every way - all effects that apply to Hardness also apply to Armor, including (but not limited to) magic enhancement bonuses, spells and effects that target or affect Hardness, and oils or alchemical items that alter Hardness. Most vehicle Armor is assumed to be made of steel, though other materials, such as mithral, adamantine, akyrium, and obdurium can be used to make vehicle Armor. To make Armor out of these exotic materials is an extremely costly undertaking; most of the time, the necessary amount of material doesn’t even exist in all of Bastion, so to do so would require importing it, making it little more than a pipe dream for most.</p>\n<table style=\"width:56.3037%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:39.2857%\">Classification</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:32.8571%\">Base Armor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:27.8571%\">Hit Points</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:39.2857%\">Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:32.8571%\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:27.8571%\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:39.2857%\">Auto</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:32.8571%\">10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:27.8571%\">50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:39.2857%\">Heavy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:32.8571%\">15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:27.8571%\">75</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Ultra classification mostly comprises specialty vehicles and custom builds, so the Armor will vary too drastically in this classification to simplify it here. Each vehicle will be a unique case, and will provide this value in its entry.</p>\n<p>Some Body Styles may alter the Armor value based on their shape and construction. The vehicle’s base Hit Points are always equal to 5 times the Armor value. Some modifications can increase or decrease the Armor, which will increase or decrease the Hit Points for the vehicle accordingly. Other modifications may also increase or decrease the Hit Points directly; these will have no effect on the Armor.</p>\n<p>Vehicle Armor can be enchanted, much like armor worn on a person, to become magical. This costs twice what it costs when improving worn armor in such a manner. Each +1 of enhancement bonus increases the vehicle’s Armor value by 2, which increases the hit points by +10. Vehicles can also be given enchantments, though they have their own special enchantments found in the Vehicle Special Qualities section.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.tletWyNIyghqkwvp"}}}

Folks lose life and limb all the time, but while there isn’t much that can be done about the former, body swaps were created to remedy the latter.</p>\n<p>Body swaps, simply put, is a term used to refer to any mechanically- or esoterically-created artificial limb or body part meant to replace a lost biological one. Hands and feet, entire arms and legs, eyes, organs - you name it, you can buy a body swap replacement somewhere. There are scavengers in Bastion who are more machine than flesh now, and you can be too, if you so desire - or are just unlucky enough.</p>\n<h2>Body Swap Rules</h2>\n<p>The various body swaps available in Odium can be purchased and installed at a number of chop shops in Bastion or even in the Wastes. Whether you’re searching for a body swap to replace a lost part, being brought in as a waiter about to kick it, or just as someone that wants to cut off a perfectly bit of flesh and replace it with cold unfeeling steel, the rules regarding the surgeries, installations, and prostheses all remain the same.</p>\n<p>This rule set does not provide a comprehensive list of mechanical penalties or other rules for what happens after losing a body part. Other systems can provide this, the Game Master can write one, or the rules can be created based on the circumstance in which they were lost. This variant rule set is more for those who want a simple system for how one goes about replacing lost limbs with prostheses. For the rules on the variant health system used in The Sundered Lands setting by default, you can reference the @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-rules.VVxBr33G7C8Xp1w7]{Special Damage} rules.</p>\n<p>In this body swap rule set, prostheses are split up into two separate groups: the actual <strong>Prosthesis</strong> of the body part that is to be replaced, and the <strong>Build</strong>, which defines what type of system it runs on. There are twelve different prostheses available: <em>Hand, Arm, Foot, Leg, Tail, Wings, Eye, Voicebox, Lung, Heart, Splanchnic,</em> and<em> Guts</em>. There are three different build types available: <em>Unpowered, Powered,</em> and <em>Esocrafted</em>. More information on each of these will be provided in the Descriptions section below.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what body part is being replaced and by what, the important thing to remember is that, apart from the special rules for each, the prostheses will all function as the intended body part. This means they can be targeted by spells that target specific body parts, that the user can still wear apparel or slotted items on the spaces they would otherwise represent, and that they are treated as the body part for any effect or condition that might otherwise affect that body part.</p>\n<p>In addition to counting as the body part in question, prostheses are also considered to be attended objects while they are attached or installed. Unlike a true body part, attacks made to a prosthesis do not affect the hit points of the wearer. They can be sundered, damaged, and destroyed just like any other object and, upon taking damage in excess of half of its total hit points, a prosthesis will likewise gain the broken condition. Unless otherwise stated, body swap components have the same hardness and hit points as a suit of full plate armor made of the same material.</p>\n<p>While a prosthesis is suffering from the broken condition, any aspects of that prosthesis that would be affected by the broken condition are affected as if they too have the broken condition. Additionally, all of the special benefits of a prosthesis are lost until the prosthesis is repaired - it simply functions like a normal body part. These penalties all disappear once a prosthesis is repaired to where it is no longer below half of its total hit points. Prostheses can all be repaired like any other object of their type, be it mundane or esoteric.</p>\n<p>If a prosthesis is damaged to the point that it is reduced to zero total hit points, it is destroyed. The wearer loses all benefits of the prosthesis immediately, and is treated as if they had once again lost the body part that was replaced by it.</p>\n<h2>Body Swap Installation</h2>\n<p>Once a body part has been lost (or the decision to replace an existing one with a prosthesis has been made), the patient must be delivered to a chop shop or other medical expert who is able to perform an installation surgery. These surgeries are slightly different depending on the type of prosthesis being replaced, but in all cases, they are stressful for the patient and must be performed very carefully in the innately unsanitized environment that is Odium.</p>\n<p>For Heart, Lung, Guts, and Splanchnic prostheses, they are permanently installed during the surgery and cannot be removed without severe risk to the user. If one of these prostheses must be replaced, it requires another installation surgery, and everything that goes along with it (detailed below).</p>\n<p>For Hand, Arm, Foot, Leg, Tail, Wings, Eye, and Voicebox prostheses, the surgery is not to install the prosthesis itself but rather to install a special mounting bracket, called a “hot swap joint” (or a “hot swap socket” for the Eye and Voicebox prostheses) at the location to which the prosthesis will connect. This installation will connect the muscle and nerves at the location to the hot swap joint, which will allow the user to move and control the prosthesis as if it were their own lost body part. The prostheses themselves are then attached or inserted into this joint.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Prostheses</strong></h3>\n<p>Hand, Arm, Foot, Leg, Tail, Wings, Eye, and Voicebox prostheses make use of a hot swap joint or hot swap socket and can be switched out for upgraded or specialized prostheses as desired. Swapping a Hand, Arm, Foot, or Leg prosthesis from a hot swap joint takes ten minutes - removing the existing prosthesis takes five minutes, and attaching a prosthesis takes five minutes. Removing an Eye prosthesis from a hot swap socket and inserting another takes one full round action. Hot swappable prostheses are designed to be swapped out with one hand - doing so requires no assistance or tool kits.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Installation Surgery</strong></h3>\n<p>Once the patient has been delivered to the chop shop, the surgery takes 8 hours to complete and deals an amount of hit point damage to the user depending on the prosthesis (listed in its entry in the Descriptions section below). This hit point damage can reduce the patient to below zero hit points, or even kill them, if they begin the surgery with some hit point damage already sustained or if they simply do not have a pool large enough to have a positive hit point pool after taking the surgical damage.</p>\n<p>If reduced to zero or fewer hit points by the surgery, complications arise during the surgery. This is resolved normally, with the patient beginning to bleed out unless the organic mechanics can stabilize them or the patient arranges for a source of magical healing to be available during the surgery. If this hit point damage would reduce their hit points to below their death threshold, they die on the operating table. If using the Massive Damage optional rule, and this hit point damage would qualify as massive damage, the patient dies.</p>\n<p>If a patient dies on the operating table, the surgery immediately ends, and the organic mechanics will inform the patient’s companions (if any) in one round. The patient can be revived, or have their body and soul preserved for later revival, if the resources are available to their allies.</p>\n<p>To perform the surgery, the operator must make a series of successful Heal skill checks in a row depending on the prosthesis being installed. Failing a check means the patient takes the surgical damage again, and the counter for successful checks resets. These checks can be retried as many times as are necessary to complete the surgery, assuming the patient survives. The cost for the surgery is 100 gp, regardless of the outcome or prosthesis being installed. Organic mechanics will perform this surgery even if the patient cannot pay - even in Bastion, medical professionals have a sense of duty to the sick and injured. The patient simply falls into debt with them, and must pay back the cost of the surgery over time.</p>\n<p>After the surgery is complete, the patient begins the healing process. Once their hit points have healed back up to their maximum hit points, the surgery is considered healed and ready for the prosthesis to be attached (if applicable). For the purpose of healing the surgery, magical healing will not count towards healing the surgery - the body must become accustomed to its new state on its own, though magic can be used to speed up the natural healing process. Once the installation is complete, all non-permanent penalties associated with missing that body part are removed. If installing an Eye, Voicebox, Lung, Heart, Splanchnic, or Guts prosthesis, the process is now complete. If installing a Hand, Arm, Foot, Leg, Tail, or Wings prosthesis, the acclimation period begins.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Acclimation Period</strong></h3>\n<p>Some prostheses do not provide sensory information like a real body part does, and it takes time to adjust and learn how to move the part, understand its location relative to the wearer, and apply the right amount of force for everyday tasks. Once the patient has fully healed, they must begin an acclimation period. </p>\n<p>This period lasts for 70 days, or 10 weeks. It can be reduced by 1 day per point of combined Intelligence and Wisdom score. Those who have already experienced an acclimation period for an installed prosthesis before also reduce this period by 7 days per installed prosthesis. The minimum acclimation period is 30 days - it cannot be reduced below this amount by any means.</p>\n<p>This acclimation period must be experienced each time a new prosthesis is first installed, even if the wearer already has another prosthesis of the same type. For example, if the wearer has a right arm prosthesis that they have acclimated to, but then suffers an injury later and must install a left arm prosthesis, the left arm prosthesis still requires an acclimation period.</p>\n<p>The wearer will experience side effects during the acclimation period. These are different for each type of prosthesis (listed in their respective entries in the Description section below). The effects listed are physical, but the Game Master may add additional side effects that can be a mix of physical, psychological, and even spiritual obstacles that the wearer will have to overcome. All effects of the acclimation are removed once the acclimation period is complete.</p>\n<p>Prostheses built using the esocrafted build will include esoteric connections that provide touch sensation just like real body parts do. In this case, the wearer does not experience an acclimation period, but recovering from an amputation or other serious injury that could warrant a prosthesis is difficult in more ways than just physically. The Game Master may still provide obstacles on a character’s psychological, emotional, or spiritual recovery, even with an esocrafted prosthesis.</p>\n<h3><strong>Extraneous Installs</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to the flexibility of these engineering marvels, prostheses can be installed even on characters that haven’t lost any body parts. In these cases, they are known as extraneous installs, and are the ultimate expression of disposable wealth and body modification in Bastion.</p>\n<p>Performing an extraneous install has the same process as installing any other prosthesis, though typically the host can go into the surgery in a much healthier state. Each prosthesis has a <strong>Limit</strong> value, shown on the table Body Swap Prices, which dictates how many of the given prosthesis can be installed on a creature. Some are prefixed with a plus (+), which indicates how many prostheses can be installed extraneously on any creature, regardless of how many of the body type that prosthesis replaces they already have. Others are simply a flat number value, which indicates how many of both the normal body part and the prostheses any one creature can possess.</p>\n<p>For any prosthesis with an acclimation period, having it installed extraneously means its acclimation period (after adjustments) is doubled - this is both for adapting to using the limb adeptly, as well as learning how to use a limb you previously didn't have in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Body Swap Descriptions</h2>\n<p>There are three prosthesis build types that can be installed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Unpowered:</em> Prostheses of the unpowered build type are made of complex and delicate Horlogian clockwork mechanisms, and were not designed with adventurers or scavengers in mind. They are available in much higher quantities than the others, though, due to how easy they are to import. These prostheses are always mundane, and thus function normally in an area of nullified esoterics.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Powered:</em> Prostheses of the powered build type are typically designed and built in Bastion proper, using scrap and auto parts to create something more appropriate for the dangerous work of the revered scavengers. These units require a steamhorse engine of at least Horsepower 1 to function, but are capable of much more than the unpowered variants. If the engine chosen takes fuel, they consume 1 unit of fuel per day in order to function. If the engine chosen has a special attack, the wearer of the prosthesis may use it once per day as a full-round action. If the selected engine is mundane, then the prosthetic itself is mundane, and functions in an area of nullified esoterics. Otherwise, the prosthetic is useless in such an area without the esoterics shielding engine modification.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span><em>Esocrafted:</em> These top of the line prostheses are designed by esoterics engineers for the express intent of being the best of the best. An esocrafted prosthesis can use arcane magic, divine magic, nature magic, psionics, or another form of esoteric engineering in its construction. This allows them to provide sensory information to their wearer, and as a result, have no acclimation period. It also allows them to be later enchanted to provide an enhancement bonus to an ability score based on the prosthetic. It comes standard with esoterics nullification shielding, preventing it from become totally worthless in an area of esoterics nullification - in such an area, it continues to function as a normal limb with sensory information, though any enchantments it may have been given will still cease functioning in the area as normal.</p>\n<p>Regardless of prosthesis or build type, prostheses can be made of any material used to make armor or weapons, though they may not all provide a benefit. If none is specified at the time of purchase, a prosthesis is assumed to be made of iron or steel, or otherwise whatever the cheapest and most readily available suitable material is.</p>\n<p>All prostheses count as masterwork for any aspect of their composition - they come ready for enchantment, strikes with them gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, built-in tools grant a +2 circumstance bonus on related skill checks, and anything else that may come up. This is already factored into their price.</p>\n<p>All prices given on the table below are for Medium creatures. The prices are doubled for Large, and again for every size category high. Conversely, they are halved for Small creatures; creatures any smaller than that still pay the price for Small creatures, as making extremely small, complex objects like prostheses comes with its own expensive challenges.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.kAfkQVXaP59YgBwG"}}}

The solution to this problem is the anti-lag system, which uses a richer fuel mixture and some extra plumbing in the exhaust system to keep the turbocharger constantly spooled up for immediate boost. Vehicles with an anti-lag system installed don’t suffer the usual XLR8 penalty associated with turbochargers, but suffer a -1 effective Integrity Resistance to their Engine. Anyone making a @Compendium[pf1.skills.YYmmxDgp0g3ltSUG]{Perception} check to hear the vehicle receives a +10 bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Dracolytic Converter:</strong> This flexible modification converts every 2 spell levels fed into it into 1 hour of operation for any engine type, allowing the magically-gifted to fuel a vehicle regardless of what type of fuel it typically takes. Spell levels can be added by holding onto a conduit which accepts the spell energy. This conduit is typically attached to the steering mechanism or handlebars to permit the driver to channel the energy themselves, though it can be mounted anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Esoengine Conversion:</strong> This module converts between types of esoteric fuel, allowing power points to fuel an arcanomotor or spell levels to fuel a crystal motor. To convert between esoengine fuel types doubles the number of spell levels or power points required to gain an additional hour of operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Esoengine Shielding:</strong> Often seen as one of the most important modifications for engines that will go out into the wastes, this complex shell of lead and exotic metals protects an esoteric engine from the nullification effects of the wastes. Engines fitted with this modification continue to operate normally in an area of esoterics nullification of any kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Flash-Evap Piston Heads:</strong> This modification was developed in the early days of the steam engine, and remains popular even today. It requires disassembling the engine and inscribing a special rune into the top of the pistons which instantly turns injected water into steam on contact, with tremendous force. A steam engine with this modification installed gains a +2 boost to its Horsepower, and loses all of its Horsepower limitations. The engine is now considered an esoteric engine, and is subject to dispelling and esoterics nullification zones.</p>\n<p><strong>Header:</strong> Rather than an exhaust manifold and a system to pipe exhaust to the rear of the vehicle, this engine vents its exhaust straight out the side with short pipes. This results in a huge performance boost, granting the modified engine a +2 Horsepower increase. However, because the exhaust system is extremely limited, it can’t support as many turbochargers as a normal engine, limiting it to a maximum of one Turbocharger modification. Hooking up the turbocharger is also more difficult and requires a different system, doubling the cost and install time of the Turbocharger modification. The Header modification is incompatible with the Anti-Lag System modification. Anyone making a @Compendium[pf1.skills.YYmmxDgp0g3ltSUG]{Perception} check to hear a vehicle with the Header modification receives a +10 bonus.</p>\n<p>This modification is incompatible with the Performance Exhaust modification. It can only be installed on an engine that exhausts some form of waste - Guzzolene, Deezil, Void, and Steam engines that do not have the Recondenser modification.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Exhaust:</strong> One obvious performance boost that can be made to a vehicle is to cut out all of the extra attachments to a vehicle’s exhaust system - mufflers are important for cutting down noise in a city, but they’re only restricting an engine’s true potential in the wastes. By removing as many bends and obstructions in a vehicle’s exhaust system, you have implemented a “straight-pipe” exhaust, granting your engine a +1 Horsepower increase. Anyone making a @Compendium[pf1.skills.YYmmxDgp0g3ltSUG]{Perception} check to hear a vehicle with the Header modification receives a +5 bonus.</p>\n<p>This modification is incompatible with the Header modification. It can only be installed on an engine that exhausts some form of waste - Guzzolene, Deezil, Void, and Steam engines that do not have the Recondenser modification.</p>\n<p><strong>Psiconverter:</strong> This flexible modification converts every 4 power points fed into it into 1 hour of operation for any engine type, allowing the psionically-gifted to fuel a vehicle regardless of what type of fuel it typically takes. Power points can be added by holding onto a conduit which accepts the psionic energy. This conduit is typically attached to the steering mechanism or handlebars to permit the driver to channel the energy themselves, though it can be mounted anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Recondenser:</strong> As the weakest available engine option, steam engines leave a lot to be desired compared to their more expensive kin. While recondensers don’t improve their performance, they do give the humble steam engine an advantage by capturing their “exhaust.” Recondensers take the steam that has been passed through the engine’s turbine and condense it back into water, allowing it to be fed back into the boiler and become steam to turn the turbine once again. Steam engines with recondensers installed never run out of fuel, unless their fuel tanks are drained or broken.</p>\n<p>This modification is incompatible with the Header and Performance Exhaust modification.</p>\n<p><strong>Solid Tires:</strong> Nothing strands you in the wastes quicker than a blown tire, so a common modification is to get solid tires that can’t be popped. These heavy tires grant a +1 effective Integrity Resistance to the Chassis they’re mounted on, and can never be punctured or deflated. However, because they cannot deform to adjust their grip on malleable surfaces, they double any offroad penalties. The listed details on the table are per-wheel, and every wheel on a vehicle must receive the modification in order to gain the benefits.</p>\n<p>This modification is incompatible with the Off Road Tires modification.</p>\n<p><strong>Squeeze System:</strong> This complex web of tubing and brackets mounts a squeeze canister in the engine bay of the vehicle, and provides all of the necessary hosiery and wiring required to charge and inject an engine with squeeze. Applying a shot of squeeze to an engine with a squeeze system is a free action made as part of a piloting action.</p>\n<p><strong>Supercharger:</strong> These powerful air compressors sit on top of the engine and are driven by a belt connected to the engine. They force air into the engine to the tune of their distinctive whine, and allow the engine to use more fuel and create more power. A supercharger increases the Engine’s Horsepower by 2. A single Engine can benefit from this modification twice.</p>\n<p><em>Special</em>: When a vehicle has at least one Supercharger and at least one Turbocharger on the same Engine, it is considered Twincharged. The combination flutter-whine emitted by the pair of performance-boosting compressor types grants a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for the pilot and their allies that are currently on board.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuning:</strong> Engine tuning is when an engine’s timing chains and other moving parts are adjusted to work in perfect harmony. Well-tuned engines see huge performance gains to their Horsepower, making the shop of those skilled in the art of tuning (typically black thumbs, but sometimes bards can also tune engines - one of the best ways to tune them is by ear, after all) the first stop for the proud owner of a new engine.</p>\n<p>Engine tuning is priced based on the benefit provided to the engine’s Horsepower value. The price is equal to the Horsepower value increase squared, times 100 gp. If you can perform the tune yourself, then there is no cost associated, but failing the @Compendium[pf1.skills.L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE]{Craft} skill check to perform the tune means you cannot attempt to tune the same engine again for 1 month. The Horsepower increase granted by this modification can exceed the normal limitations of an engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Turbocharger:</strong> These small turbines are set inside (or near) the engine bay of a vehicle and are driven by the engine’s own exhaust system. Like the supercharger, it is an air compressor that forces additional air into the engine (and emits a pleasing flutter), allowing it to use more fuel while maintaining the ideal ratio of air and fuel. A turbocharger increases the Engine’s Horsepower by 1, but applies a 5% penalty to the vehicle’s XLR8 (after being modified by the Horsepower increase) due to the spin-up time. A single Engine can benefit from this modification four times.</p>\n<p><em>Special</em>: When a vehicle has at least one Supercharger and at least one Turbocharger on the same Engine, it is considered Twincharged. The combination flutter-whine emitted by the pair of performance-boosting compressor types grants a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for the pilot and their allies that are currently on board.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.nucEucmd5gIJ4BrZ"}}}
{"_id":"heVI4TL1SIJVyHYP","name":"Vehicles - Ultras","content":"<p>For some pilots, the ultimate expression of their craft is to be at the helm of a mountainous machine operating at the absolute limits of (and oftentimes pushing the bounds of) modern engineering. Because they exist at the edge of what is possible for a single machine, Ultras have some unique rules for their operation and management that sets them apart from other vehicle types.</p>\n<p>Chief among these unique rules is that Ultra components do not behave the same way that those of other vehicles do. Their engines, transmissions, chassis, suspensions, and bodies are integrated into the vehicle in such a way that they cannot be divorced from them. This makes every component of an Ultra specific to that Ultra - they cannot have their parts swapped out or replaced with something drastically different to transform them in the same way that vehicles of other classifications can. Repairs to Ultras are purely narrative, and may occasionally require seeking out a rare proprietary part.</p>\n<p>Rather than calculating an Ultra’s assembled vehicle stats from the stats of its components, an Ultra will always come with its assembled stats as part of its write-up. These stats may not make sense in relation to each other, but that’s part of the wonder of Ultras - they are operating at such incredible scales to where their engineering solutions are sometimes unthinkable.</p>\n<p>So, what purpose does an Ultra’s components serve? Each component still has an Integrity value, and occasionally innate Integrity Resistance, to permit the Ultra to make Push attempts. Pilots of Ultras are often reluctant to make Push attempts unless they absolutely must, since finding replacements should a component’s Integrity reach zero is difficult.</p>\n<p>Because Ultras treat components differently than other vehicles, most vehicle modifications are not compatible with Ultras in general. This may make them appear to have less customization options in general, and as far as the rules for Vehicles are concerned, that is true. Instead, Ultra customization is richest outside of these rules - it is best to think of Ultras as mobile fortresses or keeps, and can be modified with additional structures and architecture befitting buildings that no ordinary vehicle could ever hope to support. Because they can be treated in many ways like land or architecture, they can also contain furniture and comfort items, as well as support as many weapons mounts as they have the floor space to fit.</p>\n<p>Treating Ultras as structures doesn’t necessarily have to stop there, though. Due to their size, some Ultras can be as immovable (unless they choose to move) as a building would be when faced with some forces, such as weather or difficult terrain. A flying fortress airship or supermassive cargo freighter can shrug off the kind of inclement weather that would effortlessly toss around smaller vehicles. All Ultras, regardless of type, take half penalties at most from weather or difficult terrain, and in some cases, a Game Master may decide that an Ultra may not suffer from these conditions at all.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0e5WLntsTb6uRTFQ"}}}
{"_id":"i5P90tVM5MaT8lPH","name":"Vehicles - Vehicle Rules","content":"<p>Steamhorses and autos got so popular so quickly, and became such an important part of Bastion society, because they were simple enough to operate that anyone could learn in mere minutes how to control them - far faster than learning how to control a horse or other living mount, for sure.</p>\n<p>This ease of use is reflected in the rules of this section, which will outline how to pilot the various types of motorized vehicles available for purchase or construction in The Sundered Lands (and elsewhere, if you decide to extend these rules to other areas of your campaign).</p>\n<h3><strong>Vehicle Basics</strong></h3>\n<p>Vehicles are treated much like other objects, though they do have some rules that separate them from your typical everyday object.</p>\n<p>Vehicles must be in a more specific state than other objects to be considered attended for the purposes of <a title=\"Damaging Objects\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects/#TOC-Saving-Throws\">making saving throws</a>. Specifically, a vehicle is only considered attended while it is in motion under its own power and has a pilot actively piloting it. Put another way, a vehicle is only considered attended when its pilot is able to react to threats at the time they appear.</p>\n<p>Assuming the vehicle is indeed attended, it functions as a mundane attended object. When subject to a saving throw, it makes saving throws as its owner. In the case of Reflex saving throws, the vehicle gains a bonus equal to its Reactivity. In the case of magical vehicles, they may use their own saving throw instead, which is given the same bonus equal to Reactivity.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pilot Qualifications</strong></h3>\n<p>First, the most important question: who can pilot a vehicle? Easy - everyone! Much like riding a horse, all characters who would reasonably have been exposed to a motorized vehicle are assumed to know how to pilot one. For most characters in The Sundered Lands, this means that just about everyone would be well-versed in how to pilot ground steamhorses and autos, at the very least. For anything else, ranks in the new @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.VTrVwSSCPSkTWjAZ]{Pilot} skill will be required.</p>\n<p>In the terms of the game, everyone is considered to be proficient in piloting ground versions of both Steamhorses and Autos, unless otherwise determined by the GM. Players should speak with their GM and work out what they might know and what they might not. One example of a player character that might start out without proficiency in piloting steamhorses and autos might be a character native to a place that hasn’t had any exposure to the technology. Except for these special cases, all characters are able to pilot any ground Steamhorse and Auto, even without any ranks in Pilot. In the event that a player and the GM have determined that a character does not automatically know how to pilot ground Steamhorses and Autos, they should gain this knowledge upon purchasing their first rank in the Pilot skill (in a way not dissimilar to the classic 3.5 barbarian’s <a title=\"Barbarian (D&amp;D 3.5e)\" href=\"https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#illiteracy\">illiteracy ability</a>).</p>\n<p>Heavies, along with all versions of aquatic and aerial vehicles, having slightly more complex methods for piloting them and less opportunities to be practiced on, are not as universally understood as steamhorses and autos in any category. Piloting any sort of heavy, or any sort of non-ground vehicle, will require some ranks in the Pilot skill.</p>\n<p>Even those who aren’t proficient in the type of vehicle they are attempting to pilot will still be able to get the vehicle to move - a Pilot check is not necessarily required to put these vehicles into motion. However, nonproficiency carries with it some penalties and conditions that will make using the vehicle to its fullest potential much harder. More information on this will be included in the Pilot skill entry.</p>\n<p>Ultras are the rarest and most difficult vehicles to pilot. They are usually one-of-a-kind machines with very specific operating procedures, and thus have special rules. Piloting an ultra, in addition to requiring a number of ranks in the Pilot skill, also requires specific training, which will take time. This is typically measured in a number of 8-hour days, and will be listed in the entry for the Ultra or left up to the GM to decide. </p>\n<h3><strong>Entering a Vehicle</strong></h3>\n<p>Rather than requiring a specific type of action, entering a vehicle seat instead requires expending a number of feet of movement as part of a move action. You can enter a vehicle at any point during your move, so long as you are in a square adjacent to the seat you wish to be sitting in, and have the remaining feet required to enter the vehicle in question. You can spread out the movement across multiple rounds, if you do not have enough movement to enter a vehicle with the remaining movement in the current round.</p>\n<p>You can see the number of feet required to enter a vehicle of any given classification and type on the table below.</p>\n<table style=\"width:29.6562%;height:85px\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:55.8393%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Classification</td>\n<td style=\"width:44.1607%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Movement</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:55.8393%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"width:44.1607%;height:17px;text-align:center\">5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:55.8393%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Auto</td>\n<td style=\"width:44.1607%;height:17px;text-align:center\">10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:55.8393%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Heavy</td>\n<td style=\"width:44.1607%;height:17px;text-align:center\">15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:55.8393%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Ultra</td>\n<td style=\"width:44.1607%;height:17px;text-align:center\">30 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:207px;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:85px\" border=\"1\">\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:112.016px;height:17px;text-align:center\">Type</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.9844px;height:17px;text-align:center\">Movement</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:112.016px;height:17px;text-align:center\">Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.9844px;height:17px;text-align:center\">+0 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:112.016px;height:17px;text-align:center\">Aquatic</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.9844px;height:17px;text-align:center\">+5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:112.016px;height:17px;text-align:center\">Aerial</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.9844px;height:17px;text-align:center\">+15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In addition to the number of feet required to enter an Ultra, they may have a specific cockpit area on the vehicle that you must reach. Most Ultra classification vehicles are large enough to qualify as maps unto themselves, so this may require several turns of moving through the vehicle’s structure to reach the cockpit.</p>\n<p>If you are attempting to climb onto a vehicle, rather than enter any specific seat, then no specific additional movement is required - you simply move onto that part of the vehicle as you would any other square, which may require climbing, jumping, or any other special movement actions as normal terrain might.</p>\n<h3><strong>In the Driver's Seat</strong></h3>\n<p>Once seated, getting a vehicle moving and driving it round-to-round is a trivial matter.</p>\n<p>Starting a vehicle is a standard action, regardless of vehicle drive type, fuel type, classification, or current integrity status. If you are not proficient in the vehicle type and classification, you may be required to make an Intelligence check, as detailed in the Pilot skill rules. If you are the vehicle owner, or are permitted by them to operate the vehicle, you are assumed to have a key. If you are not the owner and are instead attempting to steal a vehicle, you must make a Disable Device skill check, treating the vehicle as a lock with a quality dependent on its classification:</p>\n<table style=\"width:54.8711%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:33.5113%\">Classification</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.672%\">Lock Quality</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.8168%\">Disable Device DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:33.5113%\">Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.672%\">Simple</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.8168%\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:33.5113%\">Auto</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.672%\">Average</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.8168%\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:33.5113%\">Heavy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.672%\">Good</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.8168%\">30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:33.5113%\">Ultra</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:31.672%\">Amazing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.8168%\">40</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Piloting a vehicle is a move-equivalent action by default, which can be reduced to a swift action with certain feats and class abilities. Only one Pilot action can be taken in a round, regardless of the action length or how many said action abilities the character has per round. In other words, you cannot substitute a standard action with a move action to get an extra Pilot action in a round, nor can you use haste or other spell effects to Pilot a vehicle twice in one round. Additionally, you cannot use abilities or spells that might grant another “turn” of rounds to pilot a vehicle twice in one round under any circumstances.</p>\n<p>When one enters and becomes seated in any seat (in the crew compartment or elsewhere) of a vehicle, they are assumed to have their safety harness buckled. While buckled, damage taken from vehicle collisions is reduced (more on this in the Collisions section), and being thrown from the vehicle is impossible. Unbuckling the safety harness (in order to leave the seat and move around the vehicle) requires no action at all, and can be done in combination with or as part of) any other action; buckling it once seated again requires only a swift action.</p>\n<p>While seated inside a vehicle, regardless of the seat, a vehicle provides cover relative to attacks from all sides by default through its paneling and doors. Some vehicles also have a hard top roof, which provides cover or total cover relative to attacks from above, as determined by the Game Master. Some vehicles may provide more or less cover than the standard - this will be detailed in the entry for their Body component, if relevant.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while inside a vehicle with a hard top roof, all characters are considered to be <a title=\"Squeezing\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#squeezing\">squeezing through a tight space</a>, and take the appropriate penalties to movement and attack rolls when using a melee weapon, thrown weapon, or bow. If attacking a target inside the vehicle’s enclosed space with them, characters using crossbows and firearms also suffer the penalty to attack rolls, and all characters engaged in a combat inside a vehicle’s enclosed space suffer the Armor Class penalties.</p>\n<p>If the vehicle is in motion and the pilot fails to spend an action to maintain its course, the vehicle is considered unattended until its pilot once again actively maintains its course or a new pilot takes over. While unattended, the vehicle moves on its previous pilot’s turn (and can still move only a maximum of once per round). </p>\n<h3><strong>The Push</strong></h3>\n<p>No matter how rugged and well-built a vehicle may be, there are limitations to what it and its components are capable of pulling off. Operating a vehicle inside of these limitations can (almost) always be assumed to be a safe endeavor. However, great pilots know that by taking calculated risks with their machines, they are often able to perform outside the normal realm of possibility.</p>\n<p>A Push is just that: an attempt by the pilot to force the vehicle into overperforming, possibly at the expense of the vehicle’s ability to operate. Any pilot is able to push any component of the vehicle they are currently operating - there are no skill checks or special feats required. While some maneuvers described in the Pilot skill do require a Pilot skill check and count as a Push, the actual Push itself does not require the skill check.</p>\n<p>A Push is made against the Integrity for the given component. Whenever a Push is made, the pilot must roll a d10. If the result of this d10 roll is under the component’s Integrity, the Push is successful - the vehicle performs as desired. However, if the result of this d10 roll is equal to or greater than the component’s Integrity, the Push fails - the component fails to perform as desired, and the component’s Integrity is reduced by 1.</p>\n<p>Components, through either abilities or feats of the vehicle’s pilot, or the component itself, can have their Integrity bolstered through Integrity Resistance. This is a number added to the Integrity of the component, which increases its effective Integrity when rolling. So for example, if a component with an Integrity of 7 has an Integrity Resistance of +1, the d10 roll for a Push must meet or exceed 8 in order to count as a failed Push, as opposed to the usual 7. A roll of 10 on the d10 roll will always count as a failure, even if the Integrity Resistance brings a component’s effective Integrity above 10.</p>\n<p>Exactly what may constitute a Push is left intentionally vague so that the Game Master can call for a Push when it makes sense for the moment, though there are some obvious examples for each component listed below. Additionally, a number of maneuvers or stunts that require a Pilot check may also count as a Push, regardless of whether or not they are performed successfully (more about this can be found in the Pilot skill entry). The Game Master may also call for a Push for additional actions the pilot may attempt to perform, or for additional situations which might be particularly strenuous for the machine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Engine:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving at the vehicle's top Speed for more than 1 minute per Engine Integrity.</li>\n<li>Traveling faster than the vehicle's top Speed for 1 round.</li>\n<li>Starting the vehicle in severe cold (0° F and below) or severe heat (110° F and above).</li>\n<li>Operating the vehicle in extreme cold (-20° F and below) or extreme heat (140° F and above) for more than 1 minute per Engine Integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Transmission:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking a double XLR8.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Suspension:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the vehicle's Turning by half of the pilot's ranks in the Pilot skill (minimum 1).</li>\n<li>Regain control of a falling Aerial vehicle (see Aerial Vehicle Stalling Speed below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Chassis:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking a double Stop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Extreme cold (-20 F) and extreme heat (140 F) requires a Push to start the vehicle, and another Push for every minute of operation.</p>\n<p>Other instances of the Push can be found in other locations throughout this section, where their announcements are more relevant to the situations that cause them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Vehicles in Motion</strong></h3>\n<p>As previously stated, a vehicle’s Speed represents a vehicle’s top Speed rating, but a vehicle doesn’t have to travel at its top Speed all the time. In fact, it’s often inadvisable - doing so for a number of minutes equal to the vehicle’s Integrity rating results in a Push. The counter for the minutes at maximum Speed that contribute to a Push is reset every time the vehicle is powered off and allowed to sit for a number of hours equal to 11 minus the Engine’s current Integrity.</p>\n<p>Vehicles spend most of their time moving forward - that is, the direction the vehicle is facing - but if the vehicle is stationary, the pilot can choose to instead run the vehicle in one of its other drive directions. This is typically limited to reverse gear for most vehicles, but some have the ability to strafe or travel in other directions besides just forward and back. While traveling in reverse, a vehicle’s Speed is limited to 10% of its top Speed (minimum Speed 1), unless it is an Aquatic vehicle or has a special rule that states otherwise. The same rules about traveling at top Speed apply to a vehicle operating in reverse.</p>\n<p>The vehicle’s XLR8 is the maximum increase in Speed the vehicle can affect upon itself in a single round. Attempting to outdo this and increase Speed by more than the XLR8 in a single round requires a Push.</p>\n<p>While moving at its current Speed, the Turning represents the minimum number of squares forward and in the turning direction required for the vehicle to move in order to safely complete a full 90-degree turn. This calculation is provided as part of a built-in feature of the vehicle sheet.</p>\n<p>While some vehicles are able to turn on their own axis (turning in place), or on a zero-axis (which will be stated in the special rules of the components granting such an ability), all vehicles have a minimum Turning. The default is a minimum Turning equal to the length of the vehicle in squares. Any vehicle whose minimum Turning is not the default will mention so in the component, modification, or ability that grants the improved turning. For a vehicle able to turn on its own axis, the center point on the side the vehicle is turning towards acts as the pivot around which the vehicle rotates. For a vehicle able to turn on a zero-axis, it simply rotates in place as it desires. In all of these cases, the vehicle can make up to a 360-degree rotation as a move action at Speed 1.</p>\n<p>Some vehicles cannot turn under their own power at all. This, like those that can turn on their own axis or on a zero-axis, will be listed in the component imposing the special rule.</p>\n<p>Traveling at top Speed makes it difficult for a vehicle to stop on a dime, and this is represented by the vehicle’s Stopping. This calculation, like the Turning, is provided as part of a built-in feature of the vehicle sheet. It represents the reduction in Speed the vehicle can affect upon itself each round, and in that way it is something of a counterpart to the vehicle's XLR8. Like XLR8, trying to decelerate more than what the vehicle's Stopping allows will require a Push.</p>\n<h3><strong>Aerial Vehicle Stalling Speed</strong></h3>\n<p>Unlike Ground or Aquatic vehicles, Aerial vehicles have to worry about traveling fast enough to provide sufficient lift to stay airborne. If they drop below a certain Speed, they cannot get enough air to flow over the wings and provide lift, and so they plummet (or never take off at all). </p>\n<p>An Aerial vehicle’s Stall Speed, or the minimum Speed required to achieve flight, is equal to double the vehicle’s Load. Falling below this Speed in-flight results in the vehicle stalling; it powers down as the engine sputters and dies, and the entire aircraft begins to fall. Treat this as you would any other falling incident, though the pilot may attempt to recover the vehicle.</p>\n<p>To regain control of the vehicle as it falls, the pilot must succeed on a Push to the vehicle’s Suspension. Once they have control again, they may perform whatever actions they choose to try and save their skin. They may attempt a Push to the vehicle’s Engine or Transmission to attempt to pick up enough Speed to fly again - and may benefit from the fall as a descent to try and pick up sufficient Speed (see Vehicles on Difficult Terrain). They may also regain Speed from the use of an alchemical aid such as fuel additives or NUDJ, from a magic spell or psionic power, from favorable weather conditions like a tailwind, or whatever else they can think of that will work. Alternatively, they may just choose to take the chance to bail before going down with their craft - assuming they packed a parachute, of course.</p>\n<p>This does mean that some assembled Aerial vehicles might have insufficient power to ever get off the ground - in these cases, it’s back to the drawing board for the black thumb who built it.</p>\n<h3><strong>Moving On and Falling Off of Vehicles</strong></h3>\n<p>Sometimes, a character may have to move along the body of a vehicle while it is in motion. There could be any number of reasons why a character would wish to do this - to get to other stations on a vehicle, to collect gear from a cargo bay, or to intercept boarders are but a few examples.</p>\n<p>If a character is already on the vehicle they wish to move along, simply moving along the vehicle’s body requires no special checks - the vehicle is simply treated as difficult terrain. However, other conditions (ex. poor visibility, a storm) or actions (wanting to move at their full speed) could require the character to make a check, or could modify other checks.</p>\n<p>Jumping onto a moving vehicle, or jumping from one moving vehicle onto another, requires an appropriate skill check with a DC of 10 + 1 per point of difference in Speed between the jumper and the target. If jumping from one point on a moving vehicle onto another point on the same vehicle, the DC is simply 10, meaning most characters can automatically succeed simply by taking 10 if they are not under duress. This check may be modified by other factors per the required skill. If the difference in height between the starting and ending point of the jump is enough to where the jumper is at risk of taking falling damage, it is handled according to the normal rules for falling damage.</p>\n<p>A driver can shake unwanted hitchhikers or boarders with a Pilot check in one of two ways. They may choose to try and swerve the vehicle sharply, to which they gain a bonus equal to the vehicle’s Reactivity. Alternatively, they may slam on the brakes, which will slow the vehicle and instead confer a bonus equal to the vehicle’s Brakes. The result of this check sets the DC to keep from being thrown from the vehicle, which must be rolled by all occupants of the vehicle who are freely moving throughout the vehicle. This check can be made with either an appropriate skill check, or as a Reflex saving throw.</p>\n<p>While moving along a vehicle, a character may use their swift action at the end of their turn to hold on to the vehicle. This allows them to maintain a hold of the vehicle until the start of their next turn. If a character is holding on at the time they would be subject to a check to keep from falling off the vehicle, they gain a bonus equal to twice their Strength modifier on that check.</p>\n<p>For any character moving along the surface of a moving vehicle, any effect that would knock them prone or otherwise change their position, as well as any vehicle collisions (described below), will also warrant a check or saving throw to stay on the vehicle, should they fail the save against that effect. A character who loses consciousness for any reason while moving along the surface of a moving vehicle is entitled to a Reflex saving throw in order to stay on the vehicle. However, if they were holding on prior to becoming unconscious, they do not gain the benefits of holding on as described above.</p>\n<p>Failure for any of these checks means falling from their current position on the moving vehicle. This may mean that they fall onto another platform for the vehicle. If the character failed their check to remain on the vehicle by less than 5, and there is another platform for the vehicle in an adjacent square that is lower than the current platform, the character simply falls to that. In this case, the character handles falling normally (including taking, and any checks to prevent, applicable falling damage, if any), and are still on the vehicle.</p>\n<p>If there are no additional platforms of lower height, or if the character failed their check to remain on the vehicle by 5 or more, they instead fall off the vehicle completely. In addition to any applicable falling damage, the player takes an amount of damage equal to the vehicle’s Load plus its Speed at the time they fell. If they fall onto a yielding surface, such as soft ground or mud, this damage is halved. This damage is considered half bludgeoning damage, half force damage.</p>\n<h3><strong>Attacking and Defending a Vehicle</strong></h3>\n<p>Vehicles are subject to attacks just like any other object, but due to their special rules and additional mobility compared to most other objects, there are special rules and considerations that must be taken into account.</p>\n<p>Attacking a vehicle counts as a <a title=\"Sunder\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Sunder\">Sunder attempt</a>, though unlike with typical ranged sunder attempts, a ranged sunder can be made against a vehicle without a special ability. Anything that applies to sunder attempts can apply when attacking a vehicle. Attacking a vehicle without the Improved Sunder feat will provoke an attack of opportunity from the pilot, regardless of where they are relative to the attacker, as well as provoking an attack of opportunity from all other eligible enemies. The pilot can either attack with a melee or ranged weapon (if able), or can instead make a Pilot check with a target DC of the attack roll result in an attempt to throw off the attack. If the pilot succeeds, the attack against the vehicle simply misses.</p>\n<p>Attacking a moving vehicle is considerably more difficult than attacking a stationary one, and considering the speeds some vehicles can achieve, it can even be more difficult than attacking a moving creature. Thus, the vehicle’s Speed imposes a to-hit penalty on any attack rolls made against it. For every 10 points of Speed difference between the attacker and the vehicle, the attacker suffers a -1 penalty to their attack roll. If the target vehicle is moving along a path parallel to the attacker, this penalty is halved (rounded down, to a minimum of -1). If the attacker is also on a moving vehicle, the penalty is doubled. Attempting a melee attack against a vehicle you are on imposes no penalty (as there is no difference in Speed), which means climbing onto a vehicle and performing a melee attack is the most reliable way to damage a moving vehicle, but doing so is a far more dangerous stunt to perform than simply shooting a vehicle from a distance.</p>\n<p>In many circumstances, a vehicle’s pilot can make a Pilot check in place of most other types of rolls that a vehicle might be subject to. Chief among these are Reflex saves - a vehicle pilot can use a Pilot check in place of the vehicle’s Reflex save. In this case, the outcome of this saving throw is also the result of the pilot’s saving throw - if the vehicle fails, they both fail, though this may not have any ill effect on the driver.</p>\n<p>When the vehicle is brought to below half of its total Hit Points, a component is targeted based on a roll against the table below. Whichever component is the result of that roll then loses 1 point of Integrity, and the vehicle gains the @Compendium[pf1.conditions.jQLJg0XQq4rx9yzx]{Broken} condition, conferring a -2 penalty to AC, as well as on @Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-skills.VTrVwSSCPSkTWjAZ]{Pilot} checks and saving throws. </p>\n<table style=\"width:41.8338%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:22.8121%\">d%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:77.1879%\">Component Targeted</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:22.8121%\">01-25</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:77.1879%\">Chassis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:22.8121%\">26-50</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:77.1879%\">Suspension</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:22.8121%\">51-70</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:77.1879%\">Transmission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:22.8121%\">71-90</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:77.1879%\">Engine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:22.8121%\">91-00</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:77.1879%\">Roll twice.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When the vehicle is reduced to 0 Hit Points, another component is targeted based on the same table, and it loses 1 point of Integrity. Additionally, the vehicle will power off immediately and cannot be run until repaired. The pilot may choose to power the machine back on, which is considered a Push to keep the vehicle running. If the Push fails, the vehicle continues running, but instead takes 2 points of Integrity to the targeted component.</p>\n<p>If a vehicle sporting a guzzolene or void engine is reduced to 0 hit points from an attack that results in a critical hit, electricity or fire damage, or from damage dealt by an explosion, the remaining fuel held in the vehicle’s fuel tank detonates. Everyone in or on the vehicle at the time of the explosion must save against the explosion - see the rules for guzzolene explosions in the Fuel section for the effects of a guzzolene explosion.</p>\n<h3><strong>Collisions</strong></h3>\n<p>Vehicle collisions occur all the time in Odium. For the purposes of this game, a vehicle collision is when a moving vehicle strikes either another object, structure, or terrain feature, or a living creature. Whether it be the result of poor performance in the Thunderdome, an unfortunate run-in with vultures in the wastes, or an intentional ramming attack as a desperate last option, just about the worst thing that can happen to a vehicle (or creature) is to get involved with some sort of collision.</p>\n<p>Vehicle collisions are treated as an area-of-effect line attack, striking everything along their path for a single turn of movement. This attack does not have to be intentional - the vehicle simply strikes whatever is in its way. For an unintentional collision, the DC for the Reflex saving throw to avoid being struck by the vehicle is 1 per 10 points of Speed difference. For an intentional attack, the DC is the half the Pilot check result made by the vehicle’s pilot (minimum 10), +1 per 10 points of Speed difference between the vehicle and its targets. In both cases, the target receives an additional -2 penalty on the Reflex save per size category smaller than the vehicle in all collisions.</p>\n<p>Damage is based on a simple base damage amount dealt to the vehicle in question, as well as whatever the vehicle impacted and all passengers and crew aboard, with modifiers and conditions affecting that damage until the final, true damage result is calculated independently for all involved.</p>\n<p>The base damage for a collision starts with the vehicle’s Speed at the time of impact. The vehicle that initiated the collision, whatever it has struck, and all crew members that are buckled in will be subject to this base damage, after all appropriate modifiers have been applied. If the vehicle struck another vehicle moving in the same direction, this base damage is instead the difference in Speed between the two vehicles. If the vehicle struck another in a head-on collision, the base damage is instead the sum of their respective Speeds. If the vehicle struck another in a T-bone collision, the base damage is instead the sum of the striking vehicle’s Speed, plus half the struck vehicle’s Speed.</p>\n<p>After the base damage is calculated, the damage between the moving vehicle and whatever it has struck are then split into their respective damages, with additional added damage applied based on the conditions of the collision.</p>\n<p>A vehicle’s Load also plays into the damage dealt to it and whatever it has struck. The lighter of the two’s base damage is increased by the difference between their Load. If what the vehicle struck was a permanent terrain fixture, or is so much greater in mass as to be immovable by the vehicle, both that target and the vehicle itself then takes an extra point of damage per 10 points of the striking vehicle’s Load.</p>\n<p>Size also plays a factor in determining damage. For every size category difference between the striking vehicle and its target, the damage taken by the larger of the two is halved, while the smaller of the two takes an additional 25% damage. So, if the striking vehicle is Gargantuan, and the target is only Medium, then the striking vehicle takes only ⅛ of the base damage, while the target takes an additional +75% of its base damage.</p>\n<p>Finally, the target takes additional damage equal to the striking vehicle’s modifiers to ramming damage, whether that be from fuel additives, spells, or other modifications.</p>\n<p>Passengers in a vehicle involved in a collision will also suffer damage, though typically, being in a vehicle and buckled in is a far less worrying fate than the alternative. If a passenger is seated in one of the seats designated in a vehicle’s crew capacity and buckled in, they reduce the damage taken from the collision by 25%, regardless of which vehicle they are in. If they are buckled into a vehicle with a cabin (that is, a vehicle with walls and a roof protecting their seat), they instead reduce this damage by 50%. All passengers buckled into a vehicle are subject to a Reflex save on the modified damage. The DC for this Reflex save is the same as that for the vehicle.</p>\n<p>If a passenger is not buckled in at the time of the collision, they are instead thrown from the vehicle, and calculate damage based on those rules as above.</p>\n<p>After all damage calculations have been made, all involved parties subject to damage reduce the damage dealt from their current hit points, with damage reduction, hardness, or modifications or effects that reduce damage from collisions applying as normal. A vehicle collision is considered half bludgeoning damage, half force damage.</p>\n<h3><strong>Wrecks</strong></h3>\n<p>A wreck is a special kind of collision where the vehicle collides with nothing at all - instead, it crashes on its own as a result of the pilot losing control, or a poor landing from a jump or stunt, or possibly being tripped up by a trap. Wrecks can come out of anywhere, which makes them so terrifying to scavengers.</p>\n<p>Despite how scary they can be, the rules surrounding dealing with a wreck are fairly simple. A wreck is treated as a collision, where the vehicle and its occupants simply set their base damage equal to the sum of its current Speed, Load, and all of its modifiers to ramming damage.</p>\n<h3><strong>Falling and Sinking</strong></h3>\n<p>When an Aerial vehicle is reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body no longer has enough surface area to provide lift, and it begins to fall. Once this has occurred, there is nothing (short of esoterics or divine intervention) that can save the aircraft or its occupants - it simply is no longer mechanically possible for it to fly. After 1 round of falling, the vehicle reaches Speed 10. On the second round of falling, the vehicle reaches its terminal falling Speed of 40. Treat the vehicle’s impact with the ground as a Wreck at whatever Speed it is traveling at.</p>\n<p>If the vehicle loses power due to some other reason, such as Engine failure from reaching Integrity 0, the pilot has more options on how to handle the situation. Typically, they can glide until the vehicle lands safely (though perhaps not smoothly - many a rough landing has resulted in a Wreck). The pilot must make a DC 25 Pilot check to successfully glide the vehicle to the ground (gliding 1 mile per 300 feet of elevation before losing power), and then another DC 25 Pilot check to land safely. Failing the first means the vehicle begins to fall, as above. Failing the second means the vehicle Wrecks upon landing.</p>\n<p>Unique to Aquatic vehicles, sinking is when a watercraft has sustained enough damage to compromise the integrity of its hull. When this happens, it loses its buoyancy and begins to fill with water, eventually slipping beneath the waves forever.</p>\n<p>When an Aquatic vehicle suffers enough damage to bring its Hit Points to 0, it begins to sink. This is a special activity that occurs on its own initiative count in combat, always going last in a round of turns. An Aquatic vehicle always takes 1 round per 100 points of its Load value to sink, with a 5% penalty per point of damage it took over the amount required to bring its Hit Points to 0, to a minimum of 1 round. Some actions may be taken to slow the sinking (typically through esoterics), but once it has reached this point, it’s only a matter of time.</p>\n<p>A sinking Aquatic vehicle fully slips below the water at the end of the last round of sinking.</p>\n<h3><strong>Vehicles on Difficult Terrain</strong></h3>\n<p>Up to now, the assumption has been that the vehicles will be running on a paved road, and for most settings, that may be true. However, there are times when vehicles need to travel off the beaten path. When that happens, the vehicle will suffer a penalty to various assembled stats based on the road conditions. The table below gives a set of stacking penalties for various types of ground the vehicle could be traveling on, as well as the ground conditions.</p>\n<table style=\"width:60.1719%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:41.3199%\">Ground Type</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:58.6801%\">Modifiers</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:41.3199%\">Paved Road or Stone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:58.6801%\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:41.3199%\">Hard or Packed Earth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:58.6801%\">-5% XLR8, -5% St, +5% Tu</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:41.3199%\">Soft or Loose Earth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:58.6801%\">-10% XLR8, -10% St, +10% Tu</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:419.984px;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\" border=\"1\">\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:170.109px\">Conditions</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:244.875px\">Modifiers</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:170.109px\">Dry</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:244.875px\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:170.109px\">Wet or Slick</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:244.875px\">-25% XLR8, -25% St, +25% Tu</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:170.109px\">Ice or Snow</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:244.875px\">-50% XLR8, -50% St, +50% Tu</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:170.109px\">Unstable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:244.875px\">-1 effective Integrity when Pushing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While in wet or icy conditions, attempting to slow down, stop, or turn at all requires a Pilot check with a DC of 20 (or, in extreme cases, a Push).

Note that wind speed penalties for a headwind can bring an aerial vehicle to such a low Speed that it would not be able to fly. If this happens while the vehicle is aloft, it stalls.</p>\n<p>Operating an aerial vehicle during inclement weather is significantly more dangerous, and a Game Master may decide that an aerial vehicle could be subject to damage from turbulence or intense weather conditions beyond what is listed here.

In some cases, the vehicle may take damage if it trundles carelessly into conditions that could puncture the hull.

The Game Master may choose to handle this however they want considering the circumstances, but it is recommended that trying to decelerate or perform any sort of vehicle stunt in these conditions always be treated as a Push unto itself, in addition to other required Push rolls for the given maneuver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aerial vehicles treat climbs as dry slopes for the purpose of determining the impact on their Speed, and whether they can perform a given climb without stalling out.</p>\n<p>When a vehicle is not traveling on some sort of established road, or even on a flat surface free of obstacles, the vehicle is considered to be offroading. Some vehicle classifications and drive types excel at this more than others, but any vehicle can make the attempt. When offroading begins, the vehicle makes an initial Push. Success means the vehicle is able to successfully traverse the difficult terrain for a distance of 1 mile - failure means the vehicle gets stuck. The vehicle must make this Push again at the beginning of each additional mile of difficult terrain traversed.</p>\n<p>While crawling over terrain that would reasonably impede a vehicle, it is wise to move at a slow and careful pace to avoid damaging the vehicle - every round of movement in excess of 10% of the vehicle’s Top Speed will require a Push.</p>\n<p>Another potential risk to vehicles is offroading through a body of water. If the water is too deep or the pilot isn’t careful, this can cause the engine to get flooded. For every round a vehicle is still powered on while its air intake is under water, the pilot must make a Push to prevent the engine from flooding. A vehicle’s air intake is considered to be underwater if the entire engine bay is submerged, unless the vehicle has a modification that raises the air intake. After a number of consecutive rounds spent underwater equal to the engine’s Integrity, the engine is treated as having failed a Push anyway.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.l29WrfB5SejHMtd5"}}}

The cost for naturally-aspirated engines (that is, an engine which does not have a supercharger or turbocharger) that exceed a Horsepower rating of 10 is twice the cost of the previous engine for every point of Horsepower above 10. So, a naturally-aspirated engine with a Horsepower rating of 11 will cost 12,000 gp (double the 6,000 gp cost of the Horsepower 10 engine), one with a Horsepower rating of 12 will cost 24,000 gp, and so on. Each engine has its strengths and weaknesses, with some even having special abilities the driver can use for maneuvers while driving.

Guzzolene is extremely volatile, lending itself to use in hyper-fast stallions and sprinter hogs.</p>\n<p>        Drivers of vehicles sporting guzzolene engines can make a Push and burn an amount of fuel equivalent to one hour of operation in order to run the engine rich, creating a massive gout of flame which erupts from the exhaust. This effect creates a 15-foot cone of fire from every square the exhaust pipes on the vehicle are located, in the opposite direction of the vehicle, dealing damage as a hellbelcher.

Instead of the normal area of effect, the vehicle trails the cloud with it for one round, then ceases, leaving the cloud over the area it passed to linger or disperse as normal.

Where other engines consume fuel, these engines convert esoteric energy into mechanical energy. Naturally, arcanomotors metabolize arcane energy, channeled into it by a knowing operator from the Weave or passed into it from the activity of the gods themselves. Crystal engines instead are fed pure psionic energy, either by an operator who themselves has the Gift, or by feeding it the energy stored in power stones.</p>\n<p>        Arcanomotors can convert every spell level fed into it into 1 hour of operation for the chosen vehicle. Crystal engines can instead convert 2 power points into the same.</p>\n<p>        Arcanomotors and crystal engines can also be overcharged to increase performance. They can be fed additional energy to immediately increase the Horsepower, Reactivity, or Brakes stat by 1 per additional hour of operation fed into it, or shift the Power Transfer up or down by the same amount, to their permitted limits. This performance boost lasts for one round.</p>\n<p>        Additionally, arcanomotors and crystal engines are practically silent, and as such, cannot be detected by sound at a distance. This makes detecting them at night a difficult task.</p>\n<p>        Arcanomotors and crystal engines do not have a base Horsepower limit. For as powerful and efficient as they can be, however, they are at an incredible risk of faltering in the wild magic and esoterics nullification zones that can be found in the wastes. Those operating a vehicle equipped with one of these engines should take extra precautions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Elemental: </em>Binding elementals to power large vessels has been a practice well over two centuries now, but only recently have the materials and binding techniques permit the use of the technique in binding elementals to engines for personal vehicles. For most, this is prohibitively expensive and far out of reach, but it produces some of the most powerful engines ever made.</p>\n<p>        Elemental engines are able to extend a paired elemental immunity and vulnerability to all occupants of the vehicle. This is automatically applied to any creature in physical contact with the body of the vehicle while it is powered on, and removed from an affected creature immediately upon their loss of physical contact with the vehicle or upon the vehicle powering down. The type of elemental immunity and vulnerability are dependent on the bound elemental, based on the table below.</p>\n<table style=\"width:46.8481%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:100%\" colspan=\"3\">Elemental Immunities and Vulnerabilities¹</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Elemental</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Immunity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Vulnerability</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Aether</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Radiation</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Force</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Air</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Electricity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Earth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Electricity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Fire</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Fire</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Ice</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Cold</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Lightning</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Electricity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Magma</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Fire</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Mud</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Acid</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:30.4225%\">Water</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:34.3662%\">Cold</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.2113%\">Electricity</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p>¹ This table contains only official Pathfinder elemental creatures and content from The Sundered Lands.

To coax the elemental out of the engine, the pilot must make their choice of a Wisdom or Charisma check as a standard action, opposed by the elemental with a Will saving throw. If the elemental succeeds, it remains inside the engine, and is immune to further attempts to coax it out for the next 24 hours. If it fails, it appears on the same square as the engine’s location on the vehicle. It shares its turn with the vehicle.

The elemental’s hit points are independent of the engine’s, but returns immediately to the engine if the vehicle is powered down or the engine sustains enough damage to shut down.

This complex series of gears and springs is able to power a vehicle without stopping, seemingly forever, without requiring any fuel whatsoever.</p>\n<p>        A tourbillon engine takes no fuel, but counts its hours of operation differently than other vehicles. A vehicle utilizing a tourbillon engine must remain in constant motion in order to provide movement to the mechanisms that wind the engine’s mainspring. Rather than counting down as fuel is used, the vehicle instead begins counting down while stationary. Once in motion again, it recharges its lost hours of operation at a rate of 1 hour gained per every 2 hours in motion. While parked at Bastion, special turntables in the Motor Fields can keep the vehicles moving by spinning them in a circle, keeping them charged and ready.</p>\n<p>        Additionally, tourbillon engines are practically silent, and as such, cannot be detected by sound at a distance. This makes detecting them at night a difficult task.</p>\n<p>        Tourbillon engines cannot be purchased with a base Horsepower greater than 12.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Void:</em> These dangerous and powerful engines are the result of an ongoing experiment by the Forscythe Company (one that is rumored to be something of a black mark for them). No one is entirely sure how they work, or even how to safely disassemble them. Contained within the engine is a volatile material that is so efficient in the energy it consumes that the engine seemingly never runs out of fuel - or, at least, nobody has ever claimed to see one run out, and certainly no one knows how to refuel them if one were to run empty.</p>\n<p>        Void engines use minute amounts of fuel, and as such a full tank lasts for so long that they are always considered to be filled. Their hours of operation seem to never deplete, and they are immune to any effect that would drain the engine of its fuel - this is a supernatural effect, and the engine has extensive shielding to prevent esoterics nullification effects from disabling the engine’s safety mechanisms. This gives it the Esoengine Shielding modification included.</p>\n<p>        Drivers of vehicles sporting void engines can make a Push in order to overextend the engine, suffusing the area around it with deadly radiation. Every creature within 30 feet of the vehicle, including occupants, must make a Fortitude save against high radiation. The radiation fades after one round.</p>\n<p>        Unlike other engines, void engines cannot be purchased through normal means. Most of those that have been found were in abandoned vehicles or facilities in the wastes, and none who own one is ever willing to part with it except when in dire need.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.tp5V3hpNnRfuVYqh"}}}
{"_id":"sXf75HdN9MmDoC73","name":"Vehicles - Classifications","content":"<p>There are four classifications of vehicles, which give a basic description of their size, shape, and role within the many fleets of the scavenger guilds of Bastion. These classifications will define what sort of parts their respective vehicles can take.</p>\n<p><em>        Steamhorse:</em> This classification describes any two-, three-, or four-wheeled motorized vehicle which is generally ridden with the driver stradling the chassis, and with the engine mounted directly beneath the driver. Occasionally, they may have different drive methods or seating situations, but the majority will fall into this description. They will almost never have a roof or other cabin structure, instead having the driver exposed to open air. Built for maneuverability above all else, these vehicles have a wide range of speeds and tend to fare better than all other classifications when dealing with rough terrain. Being the cheapest vehicles to manufacture means they are available in a wide range of configurations, with versions existing for nearly every size enthusiast. The majority will count as Small through Large size.</p>\n<p><em>        Auto:</em> This classification describes any motorized vehicle with three or more wheels that is primarily designed for transporting people as opposed to cargo. Most house their engines in an engine bay, protecting it from outside harm, unlike the Steamhorses whose engines are largely exposed. Most, but not all, will have a cabin structure, and some may have added spaces to carry additional cargo or passengers. Not as flexible in sizing as the Steamhorses, Autos are typically built to be driven by Medium-size creatures (though Small-size creatures can make modifications) and tend mostly towards the sizes Large through Huge.</p>\n<p><em>        Heavies:</em> This classification describes any motorized vehicle with four or more wheels that is primarily designed to transport cargo. Their shapes may vary in a number of ways, but each will typically have a cabin that can support up to three individuals and either a large integrated storage area for cargo, or a towing system to pull separate vehicles that exclusively store cargo. Their design and manufacture is almost exclusively seen as the territory of the dwarves, whose practical minds are well suited to their conception. Built for work and little else, these come in sizes ranging from Huge through Colossal.</p>\n<p><em>        Ultras:</em> This classification describes any motorized vehicle that exceeds a Heavy in size by a considerable amount. Very little else can be used to classify these monstrous machines by way of description, as they are typically built with a specialized purpose in mind. These may appear in the wastes as repurposed mining equipment, large transportation vessels, or airships, to name but a few. Many have completely custom components that are incompatible with any other classification or even other vehicles within the Ultra class. Their operation typically requires dedicated training which brings with it a great deal of respect from other operators and scavengers - Ultra pilots are seen as prized assets to any scavenger guild they happen to join. These vehicles will rarely fit into anything less than the Colossal size category, and some go beyond even that.</p>\n<p>In addition to the four classifications, there are also three main types of vehicle that communicate how it moves - whether it moves along the ground, floats or swims through the water, or flies in the air. These are referred to as <em>Ground</em>, <em>Aquatic</em>, and <em>Aerial </em>respectively.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1lfa3hxP36TvyP5f"}}}
{"name":"Vehicles - Suspension Descriptions","content":"<p><strong>Suspensions:</strong> The base cost for a suspension system is listed on the table Component Costs - Suspension. The cost for suspensions that exceed a Reactivity rating of 10 is the sum of the price for the two previous Reactivity ratings. So, a suspension with a Reactivity rating of 11 will cost 1,440 gp (the sum of 890 gp for a Reactivity 10 suspension, and 550 gp for a Reactivity 9 suspension). There are two considerations for a suspension: its <strong>Type</strong>, or method of operation; and its <strong>Dependency</strong>, or whether the wheels on an axle can move together or separately. Some types of suspensions will have a limit on how much Reactivity they can have.</p>\n<p><strong>        Type:</strong></p>\n<p>        <em>Mechanical: </em>Most suspensions will use a mechanical system for their suspension. For ground vehicles, that usually means either a torsion bar or some manner of coil or leaf spring. Aerial and aquatic vehicles instead use a system of levers, gears, and pulleys to operate the wing and fin flaps, or rudder and foils.</p>\n<p>        Mechanical suspensions cannot be purchased with a base Reactivity greater than 8.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Hydraulic:</em> These suspensions will use pistons filled with an incompressible liquid instead of compressing a spring or twisting a bar. This allows a traveling wheel to spring back into position, or apply force to a fin or rudder to move with more conviction against the medium the vehicle travels through.</p>\n<p>        Hydraulic suspensions cannot be purchased with a base Reactivity greater than 10.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Pneumatic:</em> The primary difference between these and hydraulic suspensions is that pneumatic suspensions use a much more compressible fluid (air), which provides a smoother travel than the more stiff and inflexible hydraulic piston.</p>\n<p>        Pneumatic suspensions cannot be purchased with a base Reactivity greater than 12.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Esoteric:</em> The best of the best in suspension technology, the esoteric suspension uses arcanotech or psionics to attach the vehicle to whatever steers it. For a ground vehicle, this means the wheels (or tracks, screw, etc.) are fixed to the vehicle with an esoteric tether, and power from the engine is transferred to it through this link. This makes the vehicle appear to be entirely detached from its wheels, wings, or other components, with everything floating in parallel. This allows the vehicle to react to any road conditions without affecting the body too much. For an aerial vehicle, this not only treats the landing gear like the ground version would, but also allows the entire wing or fin to rotate and affect turning. For aquatic vehicles, this affects the rudder (and hydrofoils, if applicable) in much the same way.</p>\n<p>        Esoteric suspensions have no Reactivity maximum. Additionally, esoteric suspensions gain 1 point of Integrity Resistance, as there are no moving parts to wear down.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <strong>Dependency:</strong></p>\n<p>        <em>Dependent: </em>A fully dependent suspension system is set up so that each wheel on an axle travels together (in other words, the suspension applies to the entire axle), for every axle. While cheap and tough, these suspensions make for an uncomfortable ride, and tend to tire passengers and pilots before long.</p>\n<p>        Anyone on a ground vehicle with fully dependent suspension can only deal with 6 hours of travel per day, and cannot effectively find rest aboard such a vehicle while in motion. If they continue traveling beyond that, they become fatigued. If they travel another full hour beyond that, they are instead exhausted. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Mixed:</em> If an otherwise dependent suspension system has at least one axle where the wheels can travel independently of each other (usually the frontmost axle), that system is considered a mixed suspension system. While not a perfectly smooth and comfortable ride, it is more reactive than a dependent system, which allows most to bear a full day of riding before finding themselves tiring of the experience.</p>\n<p>        Anyone on a ground vehicle with a mixed suspension can only deal with 8 hours of travel per day, and cannot effectively find rest aboard such a vehicle while in motion. If they continue traveling beyond that, they become fatigued. If they travel another full hour beyond that, they are instead exhausted. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>        <em>Fully Independent:</em> Top of the line suspension systems will have every point of contact travel independently of all others, making the system fully independent. Ground vehicles equipped with these are preferred by any who have had the privilege to travel long distances in them. As for aerial and aquatic vehicles, they <strong>MUST </strong>utilize such suspension systems in order to operate effectively.</p>\n<p>        Anyone on a vehicle with a fully independent suspension can travel any amount of time without tiring of the riding itself, and are able to effectively rest aboard such a vehicle while in motion, given that there are no external conditions preventing rest such as inclement weather or turbulence.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wb6pJe0d27w06PwG"}},"_id":"v9CTejiMLBDcFP3p"}
{"name":"Flare Communication","content":"<p>Flares are small, cylindrical pyrotechnic devices that can be used to signal location and communicate over long distances. They can be shot out of a flare gun, or lit manually. When shot out of a flare gun, they burn brightly so that they can be seen at night, and burst with colored chalk to be seen during the day. Lighting a flare manually is a move action, after which it immediately sheds light like a sunrod and emits a small trail of smoke the same color as the light it produces. Flares typically burn and emit smoke with a bright red color, but can be purchased in other colors, at no additional cost, that can be used to send messages over distance. Flares can also be thrown with a 10-foot range increment. Flares that land in flammable material will instantly set it alight. Flares burn for 1 minute before they burn out completely.</p>\n<p>Flare communication is a pseudo-language used to communicate over large distances. Each color has a vague meaning, and can be combined with other flares to communicate more complex messages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red means danger or aggression.</li>\n<li>Orange means caution.</li>\n<li>Yellow means failure.</li>\n<li>Green means safe or secure.</li>\n<li>Blue means success.</li>\n<li>Purple means important or high-value.</li>\n<li>Black means dead or death.</li>\n<li>Gray means neutral or nothing.</li>\n<li>Magenta means unusual or weird.</li>\n<li>White means peace or nonaggression.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These flares can be sent up in one-, two-, or three-color combinations to convey increasingly complex or specific messages. Typically, the order of colors is significant: the first flare communicates the state of the party sending the flare, the second flare communicates how the intended viewing party should see the sending party, and the third flare indicates an order or provides a status update. For example, a red flare on its own indicates that the sending party is in danger, while a white flare by itself might mean, “we come in peace.” A white flare followed by a red flare could mean, “we come in peace, but are prepared to defend ourselves if necessary.” Three white flares would indicate surrender. One well-known color combination is red-red-black, known as the dreaded bloodsmoke cloud. Seeing this in the wastes means that a hunt or a war has been declared, and could mean trouble for you very, very soon.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wYh1Tz4GglXc5QNn"}},"_id":"whSQco27BOb27Pkg"}
