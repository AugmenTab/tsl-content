{"name":"Engineering","type":"feat","img":"icons/commodities/tech/blueprint.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 5th level, the black thumb begins to embody the reputation of their trade, and starts to create improvised mundane solutions to esoteric problems. Through meticulous design, creative engineering, and no small amount of luck, they learn to modify weapons to emulate the effects of certain esoteric weapon enchantments, without any magic whatsoever.</p>\n<p>To modify a weapon, the black thumb must first choose an enchantment (or number of enchantments) that they wish to emulate. They may choose from the list on Table: Engineered Enchantments. The combination of chosen enchantments must be less than or equal to the total enchantment level they are allowed to replicate. Beginning at 5th level, this limit is +1. Every four levels thereafter, the enchantment level the black thumb can replicate increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level.</p>\n<p>These engineered enchantments, while mimicking the effects of magical or psionic weapon enchantments, differ from them in a number of key ways. Engineering enchantments are mundane - they continue to function as intended in an antimagic field or other esoterics nullification area. They do not provide an enhancement bonus to attack or damage rolls beyond the effects of the enchantments themselves. Unlike magic weapons, they do not require that a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls be enchanted onto the weapon in order to add the engineered enchantments. However, they are still considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p>Engineered enchantments will also interact with esoteric enchantments in slightly different ways. Regardless of the number of engineered enchantments on a weapon, it can still be esoterically enchanted as any normal weapon can. The base weapon must still meet all requirements in order to be enchanted, such as being a masterwork weapon, even though engineered enchantments have no such requirement. Any esoteric enchantment and engineered enchantment that have the same effect cannot be applied at the same time to the same weapon, and indeed, no engineered enchantment can be applied twice to the same weapon at the same time. An engineered enchantment that replicates an esoteric enchantment that serves as a prerequisite or synergy requirement for another cannot serve this purpose, nor is the reverse true - any synergistic enchantments must both be of the same type.</p>\n<p>The black thumb may apply any modifications they can replicate to as many weapons as they desire, in any combination they desire (so long as they do not exceed the total enchantment level they can replicate). A weapon modified in this manner is only practically usable by the black thumb - it has so many unique quirks and peculiarities that only the black thumb can hope to understand and account for them without having spent a significant amount of time to become familiar with it. For anyone wielding a weapon modified by a black thumb, they are considered not proficient with it, even if they would normally be proficient with the base weapon, unless they have taken an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat to become proficient with that specific weapon. If they have such a feat, they continue to be proficient with that particular weapon regardless of which engineered enchantments the black thumb may have applied to it.</p>\n<p>To modify (or unmodify) a weapon with an engineered enchantment, the black thumb must spend a number of hours tinkering with their slapdash weapon as stated on Table 2: Engineered Enchantments. If a weapon already has an engineered enchantment on it, the black thumb must spend the difference between the new engineered enchantment level of the weapon and its previous engineered enchantment level. So, if a weapon has a +1 engineered enchantment, and a black thumb wants to engineer a +2 enchantment onto it, she must spend 3 hours modifying the weapon, since the crafting time difference between its new engineering enchantment level of +3 and its starting engineering enchantment level of +1 is 3 hours. A black thumb can remove any engineered enchantment currently occupying a weapon in order to replace it with a different one, which requires the same amount of crafting time for the removed enchantment&rsquo;s level. If a black thumb is not at a location with access to sufficient tooling, such as her workshop, these times are doubled.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Engineered Enchantment</td>\n<td>Enchantment Level</td>\n<td>Crafting Time</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>corrosive, countering, flaming, keen, neutralizing, quencing, returning, seeking, shock, shocking, thawing, vicious</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>1 hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bane, (elemental) burst, lesser designating, glorious, igniting (and similar elemental effects), stalking</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>2 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ambushing,, anarchic, axiomatic, disruption, furyborn, holy, impact, unholy</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>4 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>nullifying, repositiong, speed</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>8 hours</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":"","autoDeductCharges":false,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["Black Thumb"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"identifiedName":"Engineering","spellArea":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.lqWiCoEUY4EnnYwi"}},"_id":"joKv7jqM3ymNAWZ3"}

Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 60 feet), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses on physical skills, low-light vision, darkvision (to a maximum distance of 60 feet), scent, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow them to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.</p>\n<p>They do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, and so forth. They do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.</p>\n<p>They can freely designate the new form&rsquo;s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form&rsquo;s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and sex) are also under their control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form&rsquo;s kind. They are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form&rsquo;s race. If they use this spell to create a disguise, they get a +10 bonus on their Disguise check. They do not suffer the usual penalty to disguise themselves as a member of a different race. Their equipment does not change with them, nor does it resize to fit their new form. Any part of the body that is separated from the whole maintains the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n<p>They are not immune to transmutation effects as a result of this ability, but they can use it to end unwanted transmutation effects currently active on them. Each turn after failing the unwanted transmutation effect, they may attempt the save again as a full-round action.
