They permanently reduce their Constitution score by 3, and begin dying (see below).</p>\n<p>Certain effects state that the victim of the special damage begins to die. In these situations, the character takes 1 point of damage, which cannot be reduced or mitigated in any way, every time their Constitution modifier in minutes passes. This continues until the body part that was destroyed is somehow restored or until the creature&rsquo;s Hit Points reach a negative amount equal to their Constitution score, at which point they die as normal. These hit points can be healed with healing spells and effects, or if the creature has the regeneration special ability. The fast healing special ability is not sufficient and does not heal the lost hit points.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[{"_id":"gtx017yz","formula":"-3","operator":"add","subTarget":"con","modifier":"untypedPerm","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"buffType":"perm","active":true,"level":null,"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"hideFromToken":false,"conditionals":[],"identifiedName":"Special Damage (Heart)","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.UsolAIoG1XvunEht"}}}

It can be reduced by 1 day per point of combined Intelligence and Wisdom score. Those who have already experienced an acclimation period for an installed prosthesis before also reduce this period by 7 days per installed prosthesis. The minimum acclimation period is 30 days - it cannot be reduced below this amount by any means.</p>\n<p>This acclimation period must be experienced each time a new prosthesis is first installed, even if the wearer already has another prosthesis of the same type.

These are different for each type of prosthesis (listed in their respective entries in the Description section below). The effects listed are physical, but the Game Master may add additional side effects that can be a mix of physical, psychological, and even spiritual obstacles that the wearer will have to overcome. All effects of the acclimation are removed once the acclimation period is complete.</p>\n<p>Prostheses built using the esocrafted build will include esoteric connections that provide touch sensation just like real body parts do. In this case, the wearer does not experience an acclimation period, but recovering from an amputation or other serious injury that could warrant a prosthesis is difficult in more ways than just physically.
