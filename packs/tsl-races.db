It was a sweltering summer night, and he was already hot from helping Papa to repair the cart wheel, which had broken when they rolled into a ditch they hadn't seen. The night was especially dark, and with Papa having twisted his ankle and Mother expecting his sibling any day now, Jordan was the only one left to go back to the village for help. He crested a hill they had passed some time ago, and was immediately struck dumb by what he saw: the small valley between the wooded hills was pure white, dusted in a layer of powdery snow! The newly-frosted trees glistened in the light of his lantern, small rainbows of light playing off the snowflakes delicately set upon the branches. He could faintly hear the laughter of children dancing through the snowy wonderland before him which, more so than any cold wind could, blew a chill directly up his spine.</em></p>\n<p>Sylvanshine are a mysterious race of fairies with a group-consciousness and powerful illusion abilities. Looking like little more than soap bubbles on their own, collections of sylvanshine come together to form an entity with a group consciousness, and a single identity. While they may look harmless, looks are almost always deceiving with these fey. Their illusions are said to be so powerful that your mind reacts as if they were real, even if you know them to be illusory.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\"><strong>Personality:</strong>&nbsp;</span>When on their own, a sylvanshine has no intelligent thought unto itself at all. They behave much as an insect would, aimlessly floating about in search of direct light. They gain all of their nutrients from light, but can still ingest organic matter by encapsulating their &ldquo;prey,&rdquo; usually small insects, in their bubble bodies and absorbing them slowly, leading some to believe there is a native fey cruelty to them even while non-sentient. As part of a greater community of sylvanshine, they present as playful and mischievous like many other fairykind. They can be unsettling to speak to as they so often choose to communicate as a collection of childlike voices speaking in unison. Sentient sylvanshine are avid pranksters, and use their natural illusion powers to play tricks on strangers and friends alike. While they may appear normal, if somewhat immature at first, they are perhaps the most alien of all the fey, more unlike the humanoid races of the world than any other creature from the fairy realms. Perhaps nothing makes this more apparent than when they die, for when a sylvanshine swarm is broken apart, the surviving bubbles cast off and become unintelligent dewdrops again, floating wherever the wind carries them with no control over their fate - until they come across more of their kind again. When a formerly-sentient sylvanshine becomes part of another collective and gains a new individual identity, it will retain select memories and skills from the consciousnesses its component sylvanshine once belonged to. Of those &ldquo;popped,&rdquo; though, what becomes of them? No one is entirely sure, but the consensus seems to be that they simply cease to be, the memories they carried gone forever. This holds weight, as the sylvanshine themselves seem to have no attachment to the idea of life or permanence on their own, content with their tragic impermanence.<span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> An individual sylvanshine appears as little more than a tiny iridescent sphere, looking not unlike a soap bubble, which wobbles and floats carelessly in the wind. A sylvanshine on its own is a mindless creature with no sense of identity. Those from the fairy realm may regard them as a sort of fey insect. As they start to gather together and swarm, however, they eventually reach a critical point - after having gathered enough members of the swarm, the collective group of sylvanshine will achieve a unified consciousness, a sort of hive mind. Still, their appearance changes little - they still look to be a gently drifting cloud of tiny bubbles of various size, some budding off of each other and others independent. However, this quickly changes when they feel threatened, or are in a particularly tricksy mood. These creatures are so adept at bending light that they can shape the space around them into powerful illusions, permitting the spaces they occupy to look like (theoretically) anything. They are also known to bend light into sound, allowing them to speak and create ghost sounds. Their light-bending skills are so potent that they can even create tangible surfaces and edges out of nothing but light, allowing them to fight back when provoked.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> []</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (?

{"name":"Selachii (Mako)","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/fish/fish-shark-swimming.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Selachii\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmO2V3RCh1m_fp8gFC4MUCLSSGCssrcXv5rZFmIUTg4/edit?usp=sharing\">Selachii</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>The selachii, also known as the sharkfolk, are a simple, solitary race that keeps to themselves. With mouths full of razor-sharp teeth and the ability to sense prey in the darkest waters, most races have a well-deserved fear of the selachii. They are completely devoted to hunting and combat, with the smell of blood in the water being what they crave more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Selachii are not as far removed from their shark relatives as some other animalistic races might be, so their actions are largely instinctive, especially when pressed or in times of stress. When they are permitted to think and are able to set their mind to a goal, they achieve that goal, with no remorse, no regrets, no fears, and no doubts. Every moment of their existence is for bloodshed, through the teamwork of a hunt or the solitary glory of combat matters not to them. While not necessarily hostile towards outsiders, they are most certainly xenophobic in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Selachii look like humanoid sharks. They have two arms and two legs, each ending in hands and feet that are partially webbed to aid in swimming. Their maws are long and flat, and filled with many sharp teeth; the selachii love to give big toothy grins to outsiders and natives of lands they may visit. Their heads have hair like humans might, and they have long ears on either side. They have long, powerful tails and a large dorsal fin that help them swim with speed and agility in the water. Their flesh is thick and tough - when running a hand along it one way, it feels smooth; run it the other way, however, and you may just hurt your hand. They range from a lithe 4&rsquo;10&rdquo; to a large 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; with females being noticeably larger and some specimens reaching much greater size.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most who come face to face with a selachii turn screaming to run the other way, and most of the time this is exactly what the selachii want. They are not a very popular race with most other sea-dwelling races; even less so with landlubbers. Some races that less fear them than respect them may hire them to protect coastal territories or underwater interests, or to escort vessels carrying cargo or people of great importance through dangerous waters. Some lone individuals join pirate crews, while more enterprising shivers take up piracy themselves. This has made them even more unpopular with seafaring races, and has contributed to a poor reputation that is not entirely deserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The selachii are indifferent toward the struggles of good and evil, and are only concerned with their own survival in their harsh ocean territories. Their shivers are matriarchal, led by a single chieftainess aided by a number of female sergeants; they (or someone who can command the same level of threatening authority, not an easy task) will be the only ones an adult selachii will take orders from. They spend their entire day seeking out prey or a combatant to spill blood, reveling in the time the blood hits the water, or at the very least merely surviving any way they can. This makes them highly chaotic by nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> The sharkfolk are a nomadic people, swimming throughout the ocean seeking new prey and places to rest between hunts. They have no lands of their own. Those that go onto the land to adventure may acquire property, but they will use it more as a place to store treasure and a temporary resting spot than a true home. They keep themselves close to the coast, where food is easy to find and treasure can be traded for more useful supplies, though they will occasionally venture further out into the ocean to follow migrating prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The selachii are not a particularly religious race, so to hear that they do not have a common deity is no surprise. If a particular shiver were to adopt a deity to worship, it would invariably be female; even male selachii will not worship a male god, especially one that represents another race. On the whole, individual selachii may pay homage to a goddess of the ocean, or the more broad concept of water, or simply to Gaea herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> The selachii have no language of their own and instead speak Aquan. More intelligent selachii may learn to speak a regional common language in order to more easily facilitate trade with local land races (or Undercommon, in the case of deep selachii). If a shiver has no members capable of such communication, they will either depend on their trading partners to do all of the translation, or will simply endeavor to thrive without trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> The selachii receive their names when they do something worthy of immortalizing, and if asked, they love to tell the story of how they got their name. The name bestowed upon them by their shiver will usually convey might, combat or hunting skill, or ferocity - the short list of traits the selachii value. All names are designed to garner respect from other selachii and to intimidate those they must interact with socially. There isn&rsquo;t necessarily a distinction between names, though certain names implying leadership or divinity are reserved only for females.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Being a nomadic race, the &ldquo;organized chaos&rdquo; that is the traveling adventurer&rsquo;s lifestyle appeals greatly to the selachii.

{"name":"Selachii (Whale)","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/fish/fish-shark-swimming.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Selachii\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmO2V3RCh1m_fp8gFC4MUCLSSGCssrcXv5rZFmIUTg4/edit?usp=sharing\">Selachii</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>The selachii, also known as the sharkfolk, are a simple, solitary race that keeps to themselves. With mouths full of razor-sharp teeth and the ability to sense prey in the darkest waters, most races have a well-deserved fear of the selachii. They are completely devoted to hunting and combat, with the smell of blood in the water being what they crave more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Selachii are not as far removed from their shark relatives as some other animalistic races might be, so their actions are largely instinctive, especially when pressed or in times of stress. When they are permitted to think and are able to set their mind to a goal, they achieve that goal, with no remorse, no regrets, no fears, and no doubts. Every moment of their existence is for bloodshed, through the teamwork of a hunt or the solitary glory of combat matters not to them. While not necessarily hostile towards outsiders, they are most certainly xenophobic in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Selachii look like humanoid sharks. They have two arms and two legs, each ending in hands and feet that are partially webbed to aid in swimming. Their maws are long and flat, and filled with many sharp teeth; the selachii love to give big toothy grins to outsiders and natives of lands they may visit. Their heads have hair like humans might, and they have long ears on either side. They have long, powerful tails and a large dorsal fin that help them swim with speed and agility in the water. Their flesh is thick and tough - when running a hand along it one way, it feels smooth; run it the other way, however, and you may just hurt your hand. They range from a lithe 4&rsquo;10&rdquo; to a large 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; with females being noticeably larger and some specimens reaching much greater size.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most who come face to face with a selachii turn screaming to run the other way, and most of the time this is exactly what the selachii want. They are not a very popular race with most other sea-dwelling races; even less so with landlubbers. Some races that less fear them than respect them may hire them to protect coastal territories or underwater interests, or to escort vessels carrying cargo or people of great importance through dangerous waters. Some lone individuals join pirate crews, while more enterprising shivers take up piracy themselves. This has made them even more unpopular with seafaring races, and has contributed to a poor reputation that is not entirely deserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The selachii are indifferent toward the struggles of good and evil, and are only concerned with their own survival in their harsh ocean territories. Their shivers are matriarchal, led by a single chieftainess aided by a number of female sergeants; they (or someone who can command the same level of threatening authority, not an easy task) will be the only ones an adult selachii will take orders from. They spend their entire day seeking out prey or a combatant to spill blood, reveling in the time the blood hits the water, or at the very least merely surviving any way they can. This makes them highly chaotic by nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> The sharkfolk are a nomadic people, swimming throughout the ocean seeking new prey and places to rest between hunts. They have no lands of their own. Those that go onto the land to adventure may acquire property, but they will use it more as a place to store treasure and a temporary resting spot than a true home. They keep themselves close to the coast, where food is easy to find and treasure can be traded for more useful supplies, though they will occasionally venture further out into the ocean to follow migrating prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The selachii are not a particularly religious race, so to hear that they do not have a common deity is no surprise. If a particular shiver were to adopt a deity to worship, it would invariably be female; even male selachii will not worship a male god, especially one that represents another race. On the whole, individual selachii may pay homage to a goddess of the ocean, or the more broad concept of water, or simply to Gaea herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> The selachii have no language of their own and instead speak Aquan. More intelligent selachii may learn to speak a regional common language in order to more easily facilitate trade with local land races (or Undercommon, in the case of deep selachii). If a shiver has no members capable of such communication, they will either depend on their trading partners to do all of the translation, or will simply endeavor to thrive without trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> The selachii receive their names when they do something worthy of immortalizing, and if asked, they love to tell the story of how they got their name. The name bestowed upon them by their shiver will usually convey might, combat or hunting skill, or ferocity - the short list of traits the selachii value. All names are designed to garner respect from other selachii and to intimidate those they must interact with socially. There isn&rsquo;t necessarily a distinction between names, though certain names implying leadership or divinity are reserved only for females.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Being a nomadic race, the &ldquo;organized chaos&rdquo; that is the traveling adventurer&rsquo;s lifestyle appeals greatly to the selachii. Many can be convinced to become adventurers if the pay is right, or with a carefully-worded promise of the spilling of new and exotic blood. Rare is the selachii that chooses to adventure for longer than a quick quest or two, but those that adopt that life are typically: males seeking to make a name for themselves to find respect from a desired mate; females seeking experience to gain more power in her shiver; or even a more even-tempered selachii seeking an escape from the hardcore brutal lifestyle the sharkfolk live.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (16 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Whale selachii are tough, but slow and misunderstood.

{"name":"Teráton","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/slimes/slime-giant-face-eyes.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1crV3MNQh71MKW3Eq6i987t_6pURvkkoBKQwe5aLUw0U/edit?usp=sharing\">Ter&aacute;ton</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>The Arlenian executive struggled to lift himself from the cold, wet alley ground, still reeling from the brand new hole in his chest. His assailant was calm, collected - acting almost autonomously as they dispassionately relieved him of his possessions to the haggard rhythm of his dying breaths. They barely acknowledged he was there, clearly comfortable with the situation compared to him. He could see something off about their skin; it was...squirming, like something was crawling around beneath it, moving toward the head. It crept across their face and, perhaps it was the blood loss, but it appeared to be changing their features as it went. The last thing the executive saw was his own face, smirking back at him.</em></p>\n<p>The ter&aacute;ton (singular and plural) are a scorned and hated race of shapechangers that have haunted the free peoples of the world since before anyone alive can recall. No one knows where they came from, but everyone knows what they are: evil doppelgangers that seek only to harm - or are they? There&rsquo;s an old ter&aacute;ton saying: get called a monster enough, and you&rsquo;re sure to become one.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> The overwhelming majority of ter&aacute;ton simply want to live their life in peace, integrated into whatever culture they have chosen as their adopters and carry on living like anyone else. The simple comforts of life, family, and the satisfaction of a hard day&rsquo;s work well done are all they want and all they&rsquo;re willing to take from the world. Others, though, take what they please from others and indulge in the pleasures they feel are owed them as recompense for constant punishment and pain, which they indeed are subject to. Given their abilities, a ter&aacute;ton is capable of looking like anyone, anything, no matter what. They can integrate anywhere into any society, from the lowliest vagrant to the highest member of the social elite, and none could be any the wiser. This is what makes them so hated - this, and what can only be described is a shared racial memory of fear and disgust across all mortals going back farther than history can recall.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Most find understanding what a ter&aacute;ton truly is a difficult process. The uninitiated simply know them as what they&rsquo;ve been told they are: a threat to the freedom and safety of all mortal races, particularly Mankind. The truth is stranger still - a race unto themselves, each a living collection of independent morphic supercells which interact as a collective, unified consciousness. However, each cell, though acting as part of the whole, will act in its own self-interest, too - it will try to survive, and this makes them a strange mix of collaborative hivemind and chaotic biological superstructure. The potential of what they could form with their bodies truly makes them the closest things to monsters in the public eye, though millenia of persecution has caused them to repress much of their prior knowledge of what they were once capable. These talents can be reactivated by looking deeply inward, or via intervention by outward forces, and can turn a ter&aacute;ton into something awesome...and horrible, should they choose to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Absolutely everyone hates the ter&aacute;ton, and one can hardly blame them. When anyone could be one, at any time, and you can&rsquo;t possibly tell, societal paranoia hooks its claws deep and refuses to let go. Even those who are willing to tolerate them only do so because they were proven wrong about them because of the selfless and kind acts of one or a small number of paragon ter&aacute;ton. Their reputation for being diabolical, deceptive, lying monsters are not entirely unfounded, as some ter&aacute;ton have found themselves in positions in life that force them to go down that path just to survive.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Despite their reputation, most ter&aacute;ton just want to integrate and be left alone. This makes the average ter&aacute;ton NPC&rsquo;s alignment equal to the alignment of the average inhabitant of whatever region they are living in. Adventurer ter&aacute;ton, however, tend toward chaotic neutral: they are out for themselves and have no compunction about hurting those who hate them in pursuit of their own goals. The masses have already dismissed them, so what&rsquo;s the harm in fulfilling their prophecy for them?</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> The ter&aacute;ton have no lands to claim. While no one remembers where they came from, all are certain (including even the ter&aacute;ton) that they truly belong nowhere. So, instead, each ter&aacute;ton is driven to find where they belong, and eke out a living for themselves there. This is a large part of what so many find so terrifying about them: they could be anyone, anywhere, at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Having no culture of their own, ter&aacute;ton in turn have no religion of their own. The origin of the ter&aacute;ton is a complete mystery, quite possibly even to the ter&aacute;ton themselves, and as such they have no known creator god or patron saint. Ter&aacute;ton worship whatever deities benefit them the most - typically, the gods of the communities or cultures into which they have integrated, deities that can provide them favorable boons for their work, or simply none at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> Despite just how far back they go, the ter&aacute;ton themselves have no language. As such, they learn the tongues of their region, or whatever race they integrate with. A ter&aacute;ton living among elves will learn Elven, while one masquerading as a human will learn the regional tongue of whatever region in which they have settled.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Much like languages, ter&aacute;ton take the names of whatever culture they have decided to disguise themselves as a member of - ter&aacute;ton will take names appropriate for their region, adoptive culture, and gender.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Ter&aacute;ton adventurers are invariably those driven to desperation by their situation. Driven from their homes, having witnessed a terrible tragedy that left them alone, or simply having succumbed to what every non-ter&aacute;ton constantly enforces: you are a monster. If that&rsquo;s true, why not embrace it? To a ter&aacute;ton at the end of their rope, if a monster is all they are, then they might as well be the best damn monster anyone has ever seen.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (17 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Ter&aacute;ton are smart and charming - they have to be, in order to remain undiscovered.

{"name":"Selachii (Reef)","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/fish/fish-shark-swimming.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Selachii\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmO2V3RCh1m_fp8gFC4MUCLSSGCssrcXv5rZFmIUTg4/edit?usp=sharing\">Selachii</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>The selachii, also known as the sharkfolk, are a simple, solitary race that keeps to themselves. With mouths full of razor-sharp teeth and the ability to sense prey in the darkest waters, most races have a well-deserved fear of the selachii. They are completely devoted to hunting and combat, with the smell of blood in the water being what they crave more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Selachii are not as far removed from their shark relatives as some other animalistic races might be, so their actions are largely instinctive, especially when pressed or in times of stress. When they are permitted to think and are able to set their mind to a goal, they achieve that goal, with no remorse, no regrets, no fears, and no doubts. Every moment of their existence is for bloodshed, through the teamwork of a hunt or the solitary glory of combat matters not to them. While not necessarily hostile towards outsiders, they are most certainly xenophobic in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Selachii look like humanoid sharks. They have two arms and two legs, each ending in hands and feet that are partially webbed to aid in swimming. Their maws are long and flat, and filled with many sharp teeth; the selachii love to give big toothy grins to outsiders and natives of lands they may visit. Their heads have hair like humans might, and they have long ears on either side. They have long, powerful tails and a large dorsal fin that help them swim with speed and agility in the water. Their flesh is thick and tough - when running a hand along it one way, it feels smooth; run it the other way, however, and you may just hurt your hand. They range from a lithe 4&rsquo;10&rdquo; to a large 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; with females being noticeably larger and some specimens reaching much greater size.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most who come face to face with a selachii turn screaming to run the other way, and most of the time this is exactly what the selachii want. They are not a very popular race with most other sea-dwelling races; even less so with landlubbers. Some races that less fear them than respect them may hire them to protect coastal territories or underwater interests, or to escort vessels carrying cargo or people of great importance through dangerous waters. Some lone individuals join pirate crews, while more enterprising shivers take up piracy themselves. This has made them even more unpopular with seafaring races, and has contributed to a poor reputation that is not entirely deserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The selachii are indifferent toward the struggles of good and evil, and are only concerned with their own survival in their harsh ocean territories. Their shivers are matriarchal, led by a single chieftainess aided by a number of female sergeants; they (or someone who can command the same level of threatening authority, not an easy task) will be the only ones an adult selachii will take orders from. They spend their entire day seeking out prey or a combatant to spill blood, reveling in the time the blood hits the water, or at the very least merely surviving any way they can. This makes them highly chaotic by nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> The sharkfolk are a nomadic people, swimming throughout the ocean seeking new prey and places to rest between hunts. They have no lands of their own. Those that go onto the land to adventure may acquire property, but they will use it more as a place to store treasure and a temporary resting spot than a true home. They keep themselves close to the coast, where food is easy to find and treasure can be traded for more useful supplies, though they will occasionally venture further out into the ocean to follow migrating prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The selachii are not a particularly religious race, so to hear that they do not have a common deity is no surprise. If a particular shiver were to adopt a deity to worship, it would invariably be female; even male selachii will not worship a male god, especially one that represents another race. On the whole, individual selachii may pay homage to a goddess of the ocean, or the more broad concept of water, or simply to Gaea herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> The selachii have no language of their own and instead speak Aquan. More intelligent selachii may learn to speak a regional common language in order to more easily facilitate trade with local land races (or Undercommon, in the case of deep selachii). If a shiver has no members capable of such communication, they will either depend on their trading partners to do all of the translation, or will simply endeavor to thrive without trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> The selachii receive their names when they do something worthy of immortalizing, and if asked, they love to tell the story of how they got their name. The name bestowed upon them by their shiver will usually convey might, combat or hunting skill, or ferocity - the short list of traits the selachii value. All names are designed to garner respect from other selachii and to intimidate those they must interact with socially. There isn&rsquo;t necessarily a distinction between names, though certain names implying leadership or divinity are reserved only for females.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Being a nomadic race, the &ldquo;organized chaos&rdquo; that is the traveling adventurer&rsquo;s lifestyle appeals greatly to the selachii. Many can be convinced to become adventurers if the pay is right, or with a carefully-worded promise of the spilling of new and exotic blood. Rare is the selachii that chooses to adventure for longer than a quick quest or two, but those that adopt that life are typically: males seeking to make a name for themselves to find respect from a desired mate; females seeking experience to gain more power in her shiver; or even a more even-tempered selachii seeking an escape from the hardcore brutal lifestyle the sharkfolk live.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (10 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Reef selachii are tough and aware of their surroundings, but slow and unfriendly.

You&rsquo;ve been dreading this moment ever since first making the deal, but once you had, it completed its side of the agreement quickly and decisively. The goods were inside your warehouse within days. None of your guards had any idea until you came in and saw the stash the next morning. Finally, something breaks from the dark of the sewer - an enormous cockroach, as long as a gnome is tall. It rears up on its hind legs, both pairs of forelegs rubbing together with nervous anticipation. You pass off the strange request for payment it made for the job - a small bag, filled with shiny but worthless baubles and a large ham that has spoiled since first offered, a fact that only seems to make the creature more pleased with the deal.</em></p>\n<p>Where there is filth, there can be found cockroaches. Tiny, unassuming little recyclers scurrying about without the slightest connection to the outside world. It would not surprise many to know that their sentient counterparts behave in fundamentally the same way. They invoke much the same reaction from people as their tiny verminous relatives, scaled up to match how one would take seeing a cockroach several hundred times its normal size. Skittish, secluded, and living exclusively in squalor, they could very well be the most misunderstood of the insect races.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Despite their off-putting appearance as giant cockroaches, ro'kuch are generally a friendly race. They are welcoming of outsiders and are always willing to assist those in need of shelter and information.

They are not interested in precious metals, usually instead preferring things like tin and polished bronze, as well as simple entertainment items like music boxes and board games. They are willing to trade away gold and gems they've collected or found for food or bits of what most other races consider garbage. They have an incessant need to clean their territories, though their clumsy and scatterbrained nature means they tend to messy things up just as fast as they can clean it.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Ro'kuch are, simply put, giant humanoid cockroaches. They have four arms, though their second set of arms are considerably weaker than the first and cannot wield weapons by themselves. Their race is sexually dimorphic: males are small and thin with large wings that afford a clumsy form of limited flight, while females are taller and more robust with small, vestigial wings and a thicker carapace. They claim to be, and take great pride in being, the first sentient race to come about, being around longer than even the first dragons. They have remained largely unchanged since their first iteration; as a result, they developed an incredible ability to adapt to the many environmental changes the thousands of millenia have brought since their first generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Much like how people don't like cockroaches, the ro'kuch find themselves unfavorably viewed by most. Their tendency to make homes of filthy, abandoned locations, their hoarding nature, their tendency toward theft, their tendency to invade personal space, and their alien appearance does nothing to offset this opinion. They are generally considered little better than intelligent pests in the areas they settle and avoid open interaction with the public for this reason, preferring instead to live in dark alleyways and underground where they will be unlikely to upset anyone. This only makes the situation worse, however, as they have a reputation for associating with other undesirable elements that tend to frequent these same locations, which they feel is entirely undeserved, considering their own distaste for most of these creatures themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment for the ro'kuch is difficult to pin down. They have no interest in good or evil, and sometimes will steal and be greedy, but are also willing to help anyone that they can. They are otherwise a well-organized colony working together for each other. The only really accurate term for their alignment is neutral, and wild variances from the described norm are exceedingly rare.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> Ro'kuch are one of the oldest and most ancient races known, with many of the other insectoid races (and, they claim, many non-insectoid races) being descendents of them. Having had the time to migrate and use their amazing ability to adapt, ro'kuch colonies can be found in any environment regardless of the climate. They prefer abandoned and filthy locations they can keep themselves busy cleaning, so are commonly found in city slums and sewers that aren't occupied by much more malignant creatures. Their ability to survive means they can also be found in more hostile locations such as deserts, jungles, the Underdark, and even on other planes.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The ro'kuch don't find themselves concerned with the divine very often, and as a result tend not to spend time worshipping. There is no god of the ro'kuch, nor a metaphysical entity that created them like with the elves or gnomes. The ro'kuch believe they were born of the dirt and the earth, spawned from the swirling of the primordial elixirs eons ago. Adventuring ro'kuch may occasionally pay small tributes to deities of travel for good luck on their journeys far from the colonies they call home.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> Ro'kuch speak their own language of clicks, pops, and whistles. Ro'kuch is an ancient, complex, alien tongue to most humanoids. It is more commonly written than the tongues of some of their descended insectoid cousins - the ro'kuch still remember the Draconic script taught to them long ago by the earliest dragons, although their handwriting is not nearly as refined as a dragon's. They also tend to learn the language of the area they settle in, though due to where they typically settle, they mostly learn the undignified aspects of such a language. One conversing with a ro&rsquo;kuch can expect any language they speak other than their own to be broken, with often misused words and phrases, added in because they hear others use them but not fully understanding them themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Much like the other insectoid races, ro'kuch names mostly just sound like a series of unintelligible clicks to humanoid ears. They each choose their own names upon adulthood, and unlike some other insectoid races who keep careful track of names indicating to which clutches they belong, the ro'kuch make no attempt to try and organize their massive extended families with surnames. The race makes no distinction between male and female names.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Adventurers: Of all the insectoid races, ro'kuch may be the least likely to go adventuring. They very rarely develop a wanderlust, mostly preferring to stay at home in the comfort of their colonies and their kin. The majority of ro'kuch choose to adventure to find something for their colony, but it's usually out of necessity and almost never because they want to.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (9 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Ro&rsquo;kuch are slow-witted and offputting, but have legendary physical resilience.

Jiahao, however, was adamant that they should not spend their money. &ldquo;We have very little left,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;and we must be sure it will last us until we get to Frj&aacute;lsbjǫ&eth;.&rdquo; Their journey had encountered hardship several times already, so they were already lower on funds than they had planned to be. It was then that he saw a strange sight - a tube of cloth, bearing a crude drawing of a human face, flapping in the wind beside a stall of trinkets and bobbles, things he would walk right past without so much as a passing glance. The strange cloth man was upright, though, and its erratic breeze-powered movements could only be the result of a draft that flowed upward toward the sky&hellip;its movements were inviting, seeming to be made directly at him, beckoning him over. Without turning to look at Mei, he said to her, &ldquo;on second thought&hellip;let&rsquo;s go take a look at this stall over here.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>The dorons are an inexplicable race about which very little is known. Believed to be air spirits occupying cloth tubes with humanoid faces drawn on them, they are in many ways representative of the bare minimum requirement for a living thing. They are funny things, and use their gift for humor and amusement to great effect as master sellers of all types of wares.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Dorons are known for their hypnotic magnetism, which they put to good effect in the sales industry. They are silly and charming creatures even when they don&rsquo;t intend to be. They are often seen making exaggerated movements for the most basic of actions, or incorporating slapstick humor into combat for no other reason than that they find it amusing. That&rsquo;s not to say they&rsquo;re all light hearts and wide smiles all the time, or that their motives for bringing laughter to others is necessarily charitable. Whenever they can, they strive to make others laugh, because they know that&rsquo;s the easiest way to win people over, and winning people over means gaining friends from which they can extract favors or make sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> These strange, alien creatures look like long, empty tubes of cloth with silly faces sewn or drawn on them, open at each end and with similar tube arms and legs attached. A breeze constantly blows up from beneath them and through their tube bodies, giving them a wacky, wavy, flowy movement that never stops. They speak, eat, and sleep like everything else (and in fact, they must do these things to survive), but always to this sporadic air-powered wiggling. Their faces never move, never change shape - their mouths never open, with their speech seeming to just emanate from their cloth faces. No one knows how they eat or speak, and few actually wish to. No one is quite sure of the differences between male and female dorons, if there are any at all - or even if there are different sexes. For all the world knows, dorons don&rsquo;t reproduce at all, and simply come into being from some unknown place. Truly, they are among the weirdest creatures anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Dorons are easy to like, because they go out of their way to be. Everyone knows that a doron just wants to sell you something, and wouldn&rsquo;t be talking to you otherwise, but being in their company is such a pleasant experience that most people overlook it and just enjoy it. Only cynics, the wisest or most stoic people, or those learned in doron confidence games or other selling tactics have the power to see a doron&rsquo;s friendliness for what it is and act accordingly. This is typically a trait found most often in high elves, dwarves, and tieflings.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Dorons have no hat in the ring, as it were, regarding the fight between good and evil. They will happily sell to both. They prefer law to chaos, even if only because it&rsquo;s easier to find stable markets in a place that isn&rsquo;t in utter turmoil. However, they relish in the black markets and unchained economies of the world, where they can sell anything unrestrained. In all regards, they are unaffiliated and loyal to nothing but money, making them very staunchly neutral on all accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> While it is believed that these strange creatures are air spirits occupying their cloth facades, they insist handily that they are not from the Ylem and they are not elementals of the air. So where they are truly from, none can say. They seem to come from nowhere, just arriving in places where yesterday they weren&rsquo;t present, immediately latching on to local customs and markets. Some find this concerning, since it so strongly mirrors the hated ter&aacute;ton. They might argue that those without a land of their own have no allegiances to anything, and some even more extreme anti-doron voices might claim they&rsquo;re here to steal the cultures of others.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> No doron has ever been shown to give worship to another being free of charge. They don&rsquo;t even make a show of pretending, unless it would help them in a sale. As far as anyone knows, there are no gods of doron &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; and if they were created by some grander power, they don&rsquo;t feel as if they owe it any fealty. Many have remarked that if there was anything they came close to worshiping, it was gold. It is ironic, then, that a creature believed to be an air spirit covets pieces of the earth above all else.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> Dorons have no language of their own, preferring instead to adopt the cultures and tongues of those to whom they sell merchandise. They have a gift for effortlessly picking up local customs and sniffing out market opportunities. This often requires being a quick study in colloquial phrases to seem more relatable; despite their strange appearance and quirky behavior, dorons are unrivaled in this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Almost as if in direct contrast to their bizarre presentation, dorons seem to go out of their way to adopt the most humdrum names they can think of. Names like Bob, Steve, Frank, Jim, or Joe are heard frequently among dorons. They use male and female names almost interchangeably, and some will adopt multiple names as &ldquo;characters&rdquo; they can use to approach different sales tactics.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> It&rsquo;s well known that the best way to find exotic items and valuable artifacts is to travel to distant lands. Dorons quickly figured out that they could be invited to travel as part of merchant caravans or, in more recent times, as part of a mercenary company, and they wouldn&rsquo;t even have to pay to do it most times - someone would pay them! This was a no-brainer. They often take up roles in the esoteric arts, given their frailty, but their strange movements and increased reach can make them unpredictable melee combatants, selling hits as well as they do anything else.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (11 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Dorons are flexible and charming, but frail.

{"name":"Selachii (Tiger)","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/fish/fish-shark-swimming.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Selachii\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmO2V3RCh1m_fp8gFC4MUCLSSGCssrcXv5rZFmIUTg4/edit?usp=sharing\">Selachii</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>The selachii, also known as the sharkfolk, are a simple, solitary race that keeps to themselves. With mouths full of razor-sharp teeth and the ability to sense prey in the darkest waters, most races have a well-deserved fear of the selachii. They are completely devoted to hunting and combat, with the smell of blood in the water being what they crave more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Selachii are not as far removed from their shark relatives as some other animalistic races might be, so their actions are largely instinctive, especially when pressed or in times of stress. When they are permitted to think and are able to set their mind to a goal, they achieve that goal, with no remorse, no regrets, no fears, and no doubts. Every moment of their existence is for bloodshed, through the teamwork of a hunt or the solitary glory of combat matters not to them. While not necessarily hostile towards outsiders, they are most certainly xenophobic in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Selachii look like humanoid sharks. They have two arms and two legs, each ending in hands and feet that are partially webbed to aid in swimming. Their maws are long and flat, and filled with many sharp teeth; the selachii love to give big toothy grins to outsiders and natives of lands they may visit. Their heads have hair like humans might, and they have long ears on either side. They have long, powerful tails and a large dorsal fin that help them swim with speed and agility in the water. Their flesh is thick and tough - when running a hand along it one way, it feels smooth; run it the other way, however, and you may just hurt your hand. They range from a lithe 4&rsquo;10&rdquo; to a large 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; with females being noticeably larger and some specimens reaching much greater size.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most who come face to face with a selachii turn screaming to run the other way, and most of the time this is exactly what the selachii want. They are not a very popular race with most other sea-dwelling races; even less so with landlubbers. Some races that less fear them than respect them may hire them to protect coastal territories or underwater interests, or to escort vessels carrying cargo or people of great importance through dangerous waters. Some lone individuals join pirate crews, while more enterprising shivers take up piracy themselves. This has made them even more unpopular with seafaring races, and has contributed to a poor reputation that is not entirely deserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The selachii are indifferent toward the struggles of good and evil, and are only concerned with their own survival in their harsh ocean territories. Their shivers are matriarchal, led by a single chieftainess aided by a number of female sergeants; they (or someone who can command the same level of threatening authority, not an easy task) will be the only ones an adult selachii will take orders from. They spend their entire day seeking out prey or a combatant to spill blood, reveling in the time the blood hits the water, or at the very least merely surviving any way they can. This makes them highly chaotic by nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> The sharkfolk are a nomadic people, swimming throughout the ocean seeking new prey and places to rest between hunts. They have no lands of their own. Those that go onto the land to adventure may acquire property, but they will use it more as a place to store treasure and a temporary resting spot than a true home. They keep themselves close to the coast, where food is easy to find and treasure can be traded for more useful supplies, though they will occasionally venture further out into the ocean to follow migrating prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The selachii are not a particularly religious race, so to hear that they do not have a common deity is no surprise. If a particular shiver were to adopt a deity to worship, it would invariably be female; even male selachii will not worship a male god, especially one that represents another race. On the whole, individual selachii may pay homage to a goddess of the ocean, or the more broad concept of water, or simply to Gaea herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> The selachii have no language of their own and instead speak Aquan. More intelligent selachii may learn to speak a regional common language in order to more easily facilitate trade with local land races (or Undercommon, in the case of deep selachii). If a shiver has no members capable of such communication, they will either depend on their trading partners to do all of the translation, or will simply endeavor to thrive without trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> The selachii receive their names when they do something worthy of immortalizing, and if asked, they love to tell the story of how they got their name. The name bestowed upon them by their shiver will usually convey might, combat or hunting skill, or ferocity - the short list of traits the selachii value. All names are designed to garner respect from other selachii and to intimidate those they must interact with socially. There isn&rsquo;t necessarily a distinction between names, though certain names implying leadership or divinity are reserved only for females.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Being a nomadic race, the &ldquo;organized chaos&rdquo; that is the traveling adventurer&rsquo;s lifestyle appeals greatly to the selachii. Many can be convinced to become adventurers if the pay is right, or with a carefully-worded promise of the spilling of new and exotic blood. Rare is the selachii that chooses to adventure for longer than a quick quest or two, but those that adopt that life are typically: males seeking to make a name for themselves to find respect from a desired mate; females seeking experience to gain more power in her shiver; or even a more even-tempered selachii seeking an escape from the hardcore brutal lifestyle the sharkfolk live.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (32 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Tiger selachii are famed for their toughness, but also for being simple and unfriendly.

They keep themselves close to the coast, where food is easy to find and treasure can be traded for more useful supplies, though they will occasionally venture further out into the ocean to follow migrating prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The selachii are not a particularly religious race, so to hear that they do not have a common deity is no surprise.

{"name":"Selachii (Deep)","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/fish/deepsea-creature-glowing-blue.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Selachii\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmO2V3RCh1m_fp8gFC4MUCLSSGCssrcXv5rZFmIUTg4/edit?usp=sharing\">Selachii</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>The selachii, also known as the sharkfolk, are a simple, solitary race that keeps to themselves. With mouths full of razor-sharp teeth and the ability to sense prey in the darkest waters, most races have a well-deserved fear of the selachii. They are completely devoted to hunting and combat, with the smell of blood in the water being what they crave more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Selachii are not as far removed from their shark relatives as some other animalistic races might be, so their actions are largely instinctive, especially when pressed or in times of stress. When they are permitted to think and are able to set their mind to a goal, they achieve that goal, with no remorse, no regrets, no fears, and no doubts. Every moment of their existence is for bloodshed, through the teamwork of a hunt or the solitary glory of combat matters not to them. While not necessarily hostile towards outsiders, they are most certainly xenophobic in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Selachii look like humanoid sharks. They have two arms and two legs, each ending in hands and feet that are partially webbed to aid in swimming. Their maws are long and flat, and filled with many sharp teeth; the selachii love to give big toothy grins to outsiders and natives of lands they may visit. Their heads have hair like humans might, and they have long ears on either side. They have long, powerful tails and a large dorsal fin that help them swim with speed and agility in the water. Their flesh is thick and tough - when running a hand along it one way, it feels smooth; run it the other way, however, and you may just hurt your hand. They range from a lithe 4&rsquo;10&rdquo; to a large 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; with females being noticeably larger and some specimens reaching much greater size.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most who come face to face with a selachii turn screaming to run the other way, and most of the time this is exactly what the selachii want. They are not a very popular race with most other sea-dwelling races; even less so with landlubbers. Some races that less fear them than respect them may hire them to protect coastal territories or underwater interests, or to escort vessels carrying cargo or people of great importance through dangerous waters. Some lone individuals join pirate crews, while more enterprising shivers take up piracy themselves. This has made them even more unpopular with seafaring races, and has contributed to a poor reputation that is not entirely deserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The selachii are indifferent toward the struggles of good and evil, and are only concerned with their own survival in their harsh ocean territories.

{"_id":"kR8NSXtjw5rcUSTU","name":"Ro'kuch (Male)","type":"race","img":"icons/commodities/biological/legs-insect-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source&nbsp;<a title=\"Ro'kuch\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14brNDDeE2fHb0pKcI15q4TFJ0j1xXOcHHQUeKr-dvVE/edit?usp=sharing\">Ro'kuch</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>You find yourself once again in a dark, damp alley, somewhat impatiently waiting near an open sewer drain. You&rsquo;ve been dreading this moment ever since first making the deal, but once you had, it completed its side of the agreement quickly and decisively. The goods were inside your warehouse within days. None of your guards had any idea until you came in and saw the stash the next morning. Finally, something breaks from the dark of the sewer - an enormous cockroach, as long as a gnome is tall. It rears up on its hind legs, both pairs of forelegs rubbing together with nervous anticipation. You pass off the strange request for payment it made for the job - a small bag, filled with shiny but worthless baubles and a large ham that has spoiled since first offered, a fact that only seems to make the creature more pleased with the deal.</em></p>\n<p>Where there is filth, there can be found cockroaches. Tiny, unassuming little recyclers scurrying about without the slightest connection to the outside world. It would not surprise many to know that their sentient counterparts behave in fundamentally the same way. They invoke much the same reaction from people as their tiny verminous relatives, scaled up to match how one would take seeing a cockroach several hundred times its normal size. Skittish, secluded, and living exclusively in squalor, they could very well be the most misunderstood of the insect races.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Despite their off-putting appearance as giant cockroaches, ro'kuch are generally a friendly race. They are welcoming of outsiders and are always willing to assist those in need of shelter and information. However, they are typically very greedy in regards to food and baubles and do not understand that theft and trespassing are seen as morally wrong by others. They are not interested in precious metals, usually instead preferring things like tin and polished bronze, as well as simple entertainment items like music boxes and board games. They are willing to trade away gold and gems they've collected or found for food or bits of what most other races consider garbage. They have an incessant need to clean their territories, though their clumsy and scatterbrained nature means they tend to messy things up just as fast as they can clean it.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Ro'kuch are, simply put, giant humanoid cockroaches. They have four arms, though their second set of arms are considerably weaker than the first and cannot wield weapons by themselves. Their race is sexually dimorphic: males are small and thin with large wings that afford a clumsy form of limited flight, while females are taller and more robust with small, vestigial wings and a thicker carapace. They claim to be, and take great pride in being, the first sentient race to come about, being around longer than even the first dragons. They have remained largely unchanged since their first iteration; as a result, they developed an incredible ability to adapt to the many environmental changes the thousands of millenia have brought since their first generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Much like how people don't like cockroaches, the ro'kuch find themselves unfavorably viewed by most. Their tendency to make homes of filthy, abandoned locations, their hoarding nature, their tendency toward theft, their tendency to invade personal space, and their alien appearance does nothing to offset this opinion. They are generally considered little better than intelligent pests in the areas they settle and avoid open interaction with the public for this reason, preferring instead to live in dark alleyways and underground where they will be unlikely to upset anyone. This only makes the situation worse, however, as they have a reputation for associating with other undesirable elements that tend to frequent these same locations, which they feel is entirely undeserved, considering their own distaste for most of these creatures themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment for the ro'kuch is difficult to pin down. They have no interest in good or evil, and sometimes will steal and be greedy, but are also willing to help anyone that they can. They are otherwise a well-organized colony working together for each other. The only really accurate term for their alignment is neutral, and wild variances from the described norm are exceedingly rare.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> Ro'kuch are one of the oldest and most ancient races known, with many of the other insectoid races (and, they claim, many non-insectoid races) being descendents of them. Having had the time to migrate and use their amazing ability to adapt, ro'kuch colonies can be found in any environment regardless of the climate. They prefer abandoned and filthy locations they can keep themselves busy cleaning, so are commonly found in city slums and sewers that aren't occupied by much more malignant creatures. Their ability to survive means they can also be found in more hostile locations such as deserts, jungles, the Underdark, and even on other planes.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The ro'kuch don't find themselves concerned with the divine very often, and as a result tend not to spend time worshipping. There is no god of the ro'kuch, nor a metaphysical entity that created them like with the elves or gnomes. The ro'kuch believe they were born of the dirt and the earth, spawned from the swirling of the primordial elixirs eons ago. Adventuring ro'kuch may occasionally pay small tributes to deities of travel for good luck on their journeys far from the colonies they call home.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> Ro'kuch speak their own language of clicks, pops, and whistles. Ro'kuch is an ancient, complex, alien tongue to most humanoids. It is more commonly written than the tongues of some of their descended insectoid cousins - the ro'kuch still remember the Draconic script taught to them long ago by the earliest dragons, although their handwriting is not nearly as refined as a dragon's. They also tend to learn the language of the area they settle in, though due to where they typically settle, they mostly learn the undignified aspects of such a language. One conversing with a ro&rsquo;kuch can expect any language they speak other than their own to be broken, with often misused words and phrases, added in because they hear others use them but not fully understanding them themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Much like the other insectoid races, ro'kuch names mostly just sound like a series of unintelligible clicks to humanoid ears. They each choose their own names upon adulthood, and unlike some other insectoid races who keep careful track of names indicating to which clutches they belong, the ro'kuch make no attempt to try and organize their massive extended families with surnames. The race makes no distinction between male and female names.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Adventurers: Of all the insectoid races, ro'kuch may be the least likely to go adventuring. They very rarely develop a wanderlust, mostly preferring to stay at home in the comfort of their colonies and their kin.

{"_id":"mulNFbxo2iFJW67d","name":"Dreamcat","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/cat-hunched-glowing-red.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eu41-8G9Md0YC6ujxYmwOUUeqFhlfRg5MeyxwTI9krY/edit?usp=sharing\">Dreamcats</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>Dreamcats are an intelligent and mischievous race of fey creatures that spend their time playing mind games with those unfortunate enough to find themselves in the great mushroom forest of the Underdark. These mysterious felines walk the line between the waking world and the dreamscape, and they walk it well.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Dreamcats are very mercurial creatures and consider themselves more intelligent and much more wise than other races, even if that is clearly not the case. While these fey have a sharp intellect, they aren't particularly wise, and what advice they may give is usually made up on the fly. They tend to be quick witted, silver tongued, and like many of the sidhe, adore deals and riddles; they jump at any opportunity to engage in them. Like the cats they appear to be, these fey are very easily distracted by new things, be they physical occurrences or simply new philosophies, notions or ideas. They are rather capricious, however; all dreamcats hold an ephemeral concept of possessions, philosophies, social constructs, and even time &ndash; as they are, by their very nature, ephemeral creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Dreamcats appear, at first glance, very much like an ordinary house cat, and markings differ from one individual to the other. A closer look would reveal unnaturally elongated ears and tail, with fur that doesn&rsquo;t seem to obey the natural dynamics of gravity. Their most unique feature, however, is their muzzle which can stretch into a grin that spreads from ear to ear. Dreamcats enjoy using their invisibility to fade parts of their body away, leaving nothing but their grin. They use their invisibility and stealth to hunt and avoid predation. They are omnivores, and will eat mushrooms and insects that live within the Leshirintaur mushroom forest of the Underdark which they occupy. They have also been known to prey on some of the larger, sapient races that are foolhardy enough to let themselves be driven mad by riddles, deals, and whispered promises - led astray until they either die from some natural hazard, or simply starve to death.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Dreamcats do not get along well with each other. They tend to remain wary of one another, as they understand well that neither party can be fully trusted. However, when they do form partnerships, they are partners for life, and tend to be exceptionally loyal. Duergar consider dreamcats a pest species, and would happily kill them on sight. Svirfneblin avoid them, as they don&rsquo;t trust them and consider them frivolous and dangerous. The sullen, cynical, stoic nature of the deep gnomes and the grim, bitter nature of the duergar clash horribly with the dreamcat&rsquo;s proclivity for teasing, mischief, and riddles, as they love making prey of lone members that lose themselves amongst the mushrooms. Dark elves, on the other hand, have a mixed relationship with the dreamcats. Some see them as useful, and some matrons even try to keep them as pets, seeing their stealth, guile, and trickery as assets, even if they don&rsquo;t consider them much better than simple beasts. Occasions of dark elf nobles letting prisoners go to stumble through the Leshirintaur to be made slowly and driven to their death by the cats as a cruel form of execution have occurred. Dreamcats respect the dark elves for being intelligent and devious, and tend to keep out of their way.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Like most of the sidhe, dreamcats tend toward chaotic alignments. Being of the Unseelie Court, they are rarely good. Though their actions could sometimes be considered evil or hateful, they avoid fraternizing with decidedly evil forces - as they sometimes say, &ldquo;they never get involved in politics.&rdquo; Their concept of life and morality in general is ephemeral, as they are by their nature ephemeral creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> Dreamcats live within the Underdark, and are most often found amongst the refulgent mushroom forest, the Leshirintaur, outside the major dark elf city Che&rsquo;elanisyloth. They do not have much of a society, and most dreamcats are loners due to the fact that they live most of their lives in hiding. Their self-reliant, prideful nature lends itself to solitary hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> []</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> Dreamcats predominantly speak Sylvan amongst themselves and when dealing with matters of fellow sidhe. When interacting with the other denizens of the Underdark, they use Undercommon, which they pick up from their proximity to the dark elves and from stalking prey within the Leshirintaur.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Dreamcats have single names, given by their parents at birth, which tend to be Sylvan words for objects they remind the parents of through their actions. Later when they are grown, dreamcats may give themselves new names that twist language in clever ways or appear mysterious.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> There are very few dreamcat adventurers. Being generally territorial and insular creatures, few wander out of the Leshirintaur to seek adventure. So often are they selfish and enigmatic that they aren&rsquo;t naturally predisposed to accepting quests or doing good in the world. Those that end up in adventures are usually those bound by word or promise or with some personal vendetta to bring to a conclusion.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (20 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Dreamcats gain -2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, and +2 Charisma.</li>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> Dreamcats are Fey, and are thus immune to spells that only affect humanoids, such as <em>hold person</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> As Tiny creatures, dreamcats gain a +2 size bonus to Dexterity and a &ndash;2 size penalty to Strength. Tiny races gain a +2 size bonus to their AC, a +2 size bonus on attack rolls, a &ndash;2 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to their CMD, and a +8 size bonus on Stealth checks. Tiny characters take up a space of 2-1/2 feet by 2-1/2 feet, so up to four of these characters can fit into a single square. Tiny races typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can&rsquo;t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent&rsquo;s square to attack it in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. Other creatures can move through those squares without provoking attacks of opportunity. Tiny creatures typically cannot flank an enemy.</li>\n<li><strong>Base Speed:</strong> Dreamcats have a base land speed of 30 feet, despite their size, and can float with a fly speed of 10 feet, with perfect maneuverability.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Dreamcats begin play speaking Sylvan and Undercommon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Defense Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-racial-traits.5USOsWtxbSPVDb82]{Bond to the Land}:</strong>&nbsp;Dreamcats gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC when in a forest terrain (including the mushroom forests of the Leshirintaur).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-racial-traits.FyyJmdN5pnxamBK1]{Skill Training (Dreamcat)}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Magic Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-racial-traits.CRFih1OgAHRMNyoj]{Fade Away}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Senses Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-racial-traits.GiE1279ludyyZkcw]{Low-Light Vision}</strong></li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-racial-traits.rEc0E34WfIeOxrDD]{Darkvision}</strong></li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[tsl-content.tsl-racial-traits.tMuZzP2l0zmfbkWl]{Scent}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Random Starting Ages and Aging Effects</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 12.6143%;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0548%;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.894%;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.95795%;\">Trained</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.5283%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5174%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.0658%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3675%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 12.6143%;\">15 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0548%;\">+4d6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.894%;\">+6d6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.95795%;\">+9d6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.5283%;\">100 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5174%;\">150 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 12.0658%;\">200 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3675%;\">+2d% years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Gender</td>\n<td>Base Height</td>\n<td>Base Weight</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n<td>Weight Multiplier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Female</td>\n<td>1 ft. 2 in.</td>\n<td>6 lbs.</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>x1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>1 ft. 4 in.</td>\n<td>6 lbs.</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>x1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[{"_id":"lqp45ogi","formula":"-2","operator":"add","subTarget":"str","modifier":"size","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"sub0y1cd","formula":"2","operator":"add","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"size","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"u3e0tl7p","formula":"2","operator":"add","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"7kgrfgai","formula":"-2","operator":"add","subTarget":"con","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"xls9mosc","formula":"4","operator":"add","subTarget":"int","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"sjnycn7m","formula":"2","operator":"add","subTarget":"wis","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"exr2xobd","formula":"2","operator":"add","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0},{"_id":"nfdmj234","formula":"10","operator":"set","subTarget":"flySpeed","modifier":"untyped","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[{"text":"Dreamcats gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC when in a forest terrain (including the mushroom forests of the Leshirintaur).","subTarget":"ac"}],"links":{"children":[]},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"creatureType":"fey","subTypes":[],"identifiedName":"Dreamcat"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Q1KTboN57aVeXTZG"}}}

A lithe female elf on a rugged steamhorse, covered in wraps to protect her delicate face from the harsh sandblasting winds. A perfect target, or so it seems - he couldn&rsquo;t have expected what would happen when he pounced. She matches him blow for blow, fist and blade darting in and finding purchase on his body in a blur. Down for the count before he could even figure out how, his eyes grow in fear as his gaze meets her swirling rainbow pinwheel eyes, the colors within spinning faster and faster as the pupils spark into tiny motes of piercing silver flame...the last thing that bandit ever heard was the joyful cackling of his quarry...and the ear-splitting crack of a supersonic bullet.</em></p>\n<p>The idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; (ij-err-ey-all-chay), singular idir&eacute;ailtea (ij-err-ey-all-cha), are a race of fae from the harsh cracked earth of the Sundered Lands. With a distinctly un-fae penchant for engines, wild eyes, and more than a few screws loose, they&rsquo;re definitely the life of any scavenging party. If you and yours can tolerate the walking entropy that is the typical idir&eacute;ailtea, then you have an unequaled asset for your next trek out into the bush.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Upbeat and spontaneous, idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are an irrepressible force for good. A closer look, however, makes it obvious that the average idir&eacute;ailtea is something of a powder keg. They separate themselves from other fae in several ways, not the least of which being their attraction to mechanical devices. Idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are crack shots, and it&rsquo;s rare to find one out in the wastes not astride a steamhorse or behind the wheel of a runabout. The explosions of gunfire and engines are like a symphony to them, and they relish the chaos of combat, laughing gleefully at the prospect of violence (delivered only to those that deserve it, of course). Some think their instability is caused by their innate psionic abilities, while others believe it is because they are simply unfortunate enough to be the nature spirits of an insane land. The fae are intrinsically connected to the natural world - perhaps this relatively new kind of fae has seen something that shatters the illusion of it all? Whatever they may know, if anything at all, the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; refuse to say, opting instead to give an unnerving laugh.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> The average idir&eacute;ailtea would be mistaken for an elf at first glance, but upon further inspection, their more exaggerated features become unmistakable. Still not having lost their attachment to the natural world, their features retain the strange, mystical beauty of nature in the way that only the fae can have, and it is the opinion of the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; that the endless wastes of the bush have a strange, mystical beauty all their own. They appear much like a longer-eared elf or a member of the eladrin race, but differ in several notable ways. They are often born with strange hair colors, and are known to dye their hair whenever they become bored of their current visage. Their eyes are a constantly swirling maelstrom of color, dancing throughout their irises and shifting endlessly, speeding up or slowing down in relation to their mood; those most excited or manifesting a psionic power look like spinning multicolored wheels set inside their eyes. Their skin is pale naturally, but they take to the sun quickly - those native to the cities will retain their pale coloration, while those who wander the bush will darken to a rich amber color with exposure.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Sometimes called mind fairies or the psidhe by other races, the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are feared, respected, misunderstood, and not taken very seriously in equal parts. Their intangible grip on reality makes it impossible for the more regimented peoples like dwarves to connect with or tolerate them. Even elves find them to be too unhinged for their taste, though the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; do get along rather well with the more anarchist sects of gnomes. Despite how difficult it is to deal with an excitable idir&eacute;ailtea, most will accept the challenge in order to have them around on a scavenging mission, as they are invaluable traveling companions in the endless wastes.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Typical of the sidhe, the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are almost universally chaotic, but these particular fae are chaotic to the point where even other fae distance themselves. It would take an extreme situation to have them adopt a respect and adherence to anything other than their own whims, so they usually go no further than neutral on the law-chaos axis. It is for this reason that the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are not represented in any of the fae courts. Despite their apparent insanity, most are jovial and interested in the well-being of innocents, so they tend toward good more than evil. For those that aren&rsquo;t chaotic good, chaotic neutral is the alternative, with survival in the bush driving them to a self-serving and ungenerous nature. The sort of cruelty exhibited by these idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; is unwelcome among their kin, who shun them for such behavior. These idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; tend to wander alone, as most races don&rsquo;t favor their company in the first place, and without the acceptance of their own people, they have no one else to turn to.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> Idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are found exclusively in the Sundered Lands, a fractured and cursed island continent where psionics run rampant and even the gods have a hard time reaching. Most of the race wanders the bush, but a fair number set themselves up in Bastion, a fortified city set inside a volcano, and the last known standing fragment of civilization on the continent. There are no known cases of idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; leaving the Sundered Lands, and none have ever shown a desire to - much like other fae, they are happiest where they already are.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> While not known for their religious zeal, idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; do occasionally offer worship to a wide variety of deities. Some Bastionites will say a prayer to a relevant nature deity for a safe journey out in the bush, and the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; are no exception. They&rsquo;re also drawn to deities of recreation, chaos, or spontaneity as focuses of worship. While not among the core essential fae, some will pray to the fae deities or to Gaia herself. Yet, others still tell terrified whispers of names and intelligences from somewhere &ldquo;between the stars,&rdquo; and dare not speak their names.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> Being fae, idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; speak Sylvan, though it is usually peppered with select words and phrases from the languages of nearby cultures in the wastes. Those in the cities will invariably learn whatever language is the common tongue of that city in order to get by more easily. Particularly intelligent idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; may also learn Elven, Ignan, or Weheloan.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; names are as chaotic and unpredictable as the idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; themselves. They are given names by their parents when born, but it&rsquo;s common for the parents to disagree on a name and each parent will call the child something different. Some idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; choose a name for themselves upon reaching adulthood, but equally as many will take a new name during childhood, or keep their given name or names. It is also not unheard of for particularly spontaneous idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; to change their name seemingly on a whim, or collect names and string them together into large compound titles. As for the origins, they tend most heavily toward Sylvan names, but may also take names common among whatever cultures are nearest to them in the bush, and many still will take names to honor friends alive and fallen - those that take such names are unlikely to accept any other names, out of respect for those they honor, though they may chain several honored names together.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Nearly all idir&eacute;ailtea&iacute; consider themselves adventurers, their constant wanderlust taking them all over the Sundered Lands to experience their homeland in all the many wonders - and dangers - it can provide.

{"name":"Selachii (Great White)","type":"race","img":"icons/creatures/fish/fish-shark-swimming.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source <a title=\"Selachii\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmO2V3RCh1m_fp8gFC4MUCLSSGCssrcXv5rZFmIUTg4/edit?usp=sharing\">Selachii</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>[]</em></p>\n<p>The selachii, also known as the sharkfolk, are a simple, solitary race that keeps to themselves. With mouths full of razor-sharp teeth and the ability to sense prey in the darkest waters, most races have a well-deserved fear of the selachii. They are completely devoted to hunting and combat, with the smell of blood in the water being what they crave more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Selachii are not as far removed from their shark relatives as some other animalistic races might be, so their actions are largely instinctive, especially when pressed or in times of stress. When they are permitted to think and are able to set their mind to a goal, they achieve that goal, with no remorse, no regrets, no fears, and no doubts. Every moment of their existence is for bloodshed, through the teamwork of a hunt or the solitary glory of combat matters not to them. While not necessarily hostile towards outsiders, they are most certainly xenophobic in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Selachii look like humanoid sharks. They have two arms and two legs, each ending in hands and feet that are partially webbed to aid in swimming. Their maws are long and flat, and filled with many sharp teeth; the selachii love to give big toothy grins to outsiders and natives of lands they may visit. Their heads have hair like humans might, and they have long ears on either side. They have long, powerful tails and a large dorsal fin that help them swim with speed and agility in the water. Their flesh is thick and tough - when running a hand along it one way, it feels smooth; run it the other way, however, and you may just hurt your hand. They range from a lithe 4&rsquo;10&rdquo; to a large 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; with females being noticeably larger and some specimens reaching much greater size.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most who come face to face with a selachii turn screaming to run the other way, and most of the time this is exactly what the selachii want. They are not a very popular race with most other sea-dwelling races; even less so with landlubbers. Some races that less fear them than respect them may hire them to protect coastal territories or underwater interests, or to escort vessels carrying cargo or people of great importance through dangerous waters. Some lone individuals join pirate crews, while more enterprising shivers take up piracy themselves. This has made them even more unpopular with seafaring races, and has contributed to a poor reputation that is not entirely deserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The selachii are indifferent toward the struggles of good and evil, and are only concerned with their own survival in their harsh ocean territories. Their shivers are matriarchal, led by a single chieftainess aided by a number of female sergeants; they (or someone who can command the same level of threatening authority, not an easy task) will be the only ones an adult selachii will take orders from. They spend their entire day seeking out prey or a combatant to spill blood, reveling in the time the blood hits the water, or at the very least merely surviving any way they can. This makes them highly chaotic by nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong> The sharkfolk are a nomadic people, swimming throughout the ocean seeking new prey and places to rest between hunts. They have no lands of their own. Those that go onto the land to adventure may acquire property, but they will use it more as a place to store treasure and a temporary resting spot than a true home. They keep themselves close to the coast, where food is easy to find and treasure can be traded for more useful supplies, though they will occasionally venture further out into the ocean to follow migrating prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> The selachii are not a particularly religious race, so to hear that they do not have a common deity is no surprise. If a particular shiver were to adopt a deity to worship, it would invariably be female; even male selachii will not worship a male god, especially one that represents another race. On the whole, individual selachii may pay homage to a goddess of the ocean, or the more broad concept of water, or simply to Gaea herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong> The selachii have no language of their own and instead speak Aquan. More intelligent selachii may learn to speak a regional common language in order to more easily facilitate trade with local land races (or Undercommon, in the case of deep selachii). If a shiver has no members capable of such communication, they will either depend on their trading partners to do all of the translation, or will simply endeavor to thrive without trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> The selachii receive their names when they do something worthy of immortalizing, and if asked, they love to tell the story of how they got their name. The name bestowed upon them by their shiver will usually convey might, combat or hunting skill, or ferocity - the short list of traits the selachii value. All names are designed to garner respect from other selachii and to intimidate those they must interact with socially. There isn&rsquo;t necessarily a distinction between names, though certain names implying leadership or divinity are reserved only for females.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Being a nomadic race, the &ldquo;organized chaos&rdquo; that is the traveling adventurer&rsquo;s lifestyle appeals greatly to the selachii. Many can be convinced to become adventurers if the pay is right, or with a carefully-worded promise of the spilling of new and exotic blood. Rare is the selachii that chooses to adventure for longer than a quick quest or two, but those that adopt that life are typically: males seeking to make a name for themselves to find respect from a desired mate; females seeking experience to gain more power in her shiver; or even a more even-tempered selachii seeking an escape from the hardcore brutal lifestyle the sharkfolk live.</p>\n<h2>Racial Traits (32 RP)</h2>\n<p><strong>Standard Racial Traits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers:</strong> Great white selachii are strong and tough, but slow and unfriendly.
