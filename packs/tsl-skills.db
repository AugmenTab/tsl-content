The table below defines all types and classifications of vehicle, and how many ranks in the Pilot skill are required to be considered proficient with them. The required ranks will stack - for example, to be considered proficient in piloting Aerial Heavies requires the sum of both required ranks, or 7 ranks.</p>\n<table style=\"width:26.7045%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2818%\">Classification</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7182%\">Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2818%\">Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7182%\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2818%\">Auto</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7182%\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2818%\">Heavy</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7182%\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2818%\">Ultra</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7182%\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:26.6476%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2915%\">Type</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7085%\">Ranks</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2915%\">Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7085%\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2915%\">Aquatic</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7085%\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:57.2915%\">Aerial</td>\n<td style=\"width:42.7085%\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When a character does not have the necessary ranks to be considered proficient with a particular vehicle, they must make an Intelligence check to start and put the vehicle into motion. The DC for this check is 10 + the sum of ranks required to be considered proficient. When piloting a vehicle with which the character is not proficient, they take a -4 penalty on all Pilot checks for each aspect of the vehicle for which they are non-proficient.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a character is piloting a vehicle for which they are non-proficient, all components on that vehicle are considered to have -1 effective Integrity per non-proficient aspect when making a Push, to a minimum effective Integrity of 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintain Control on Difficult Terrain:</strong> While in wet or icy conditions, attempting to slow down, stop, or turn at all requires a Pilot check with a DC of 20 (or, in extreme cases, a Push). Failure means the vehicle skids (in the case of a stop) or fails to turn (in the case of a turn), and the vehicle continues moving straight at its current speed for the turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a Collision Attack:</strong> Pilots are able to weaponize their vehicles against creatures, structures, objects, or other vehicles, though perhaps at a great cost. For an intentional ramming attack, the pilot makes a Pilot check, with the Reflex save DC to avoid being hit by the vehicle being half the result of that check (minimum 10), +1 per 10 points of Speed difference between the vehicle and its targets. In both cases, the target receives an additional -2 penalty on the Reflex save per size category smaller than the vehicle in all collisions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong>Make an Engine Special Attack:</strong> </span>Some engines are capable of making special attacks or producing special effects that are unique to their engine type. Pilots can activate these abilities using a Pilot check in place of an attack roll, with no possibility of a misfire - failure simply means the attack fails to produce meaningful results.<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><strong>Perform Special Maneuvers While Piloting:</strong> Beyond the normal piloting of a vehicle, some vehicle maneuvers can be useful to provide additional benefits as offensive or defensive actions in a vehicle combat scenario. Unless otherwise specified, using a maneuver is done as part of a Pilot action, and a pilot is limited to one maneuver per Pilot action.</p>\n<p>Failure for a maneuver can mean several things, but typically failing the Push against the linked component simply results in the usual consequences for failing a Push on that component. Failing the Pilot check that comes first will result in the pilot having to pull out of the maneuver, wasting their opportunity to perform a maneuver for that round. If the Pilot check is failed by 10 or more, the failed attempt will result in a Wreck.</p>\n<table style=\"width:73.7822%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Maneuver</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Limitations</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">Pilot DC</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">Push Component</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Bootleg Turn</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">Current Sp</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">Chassis + Engine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Burnout</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground, Wheel Chassis</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">10 + 2/round</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">See entry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Dodge</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">--</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">See entry</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Drift</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">15 + 2/round</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Handbrake Turn</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">18</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">Suspension</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Jump</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Aquatic or Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">See entry</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">Chassis + Suspension</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Launch</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">--</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">XLR8</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">Transmission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Shake</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">--</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Stoppie</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground Steamhorse</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">15 + 2/round</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">--</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Two-Wheels</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground (4+ wheels)</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">18 + 2/round</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">Chassis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.7899%\">Wheelie</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.3774%\">Ground</td>\n<td style=\"width:19.0661%\">12 + 2/round</td>\n<td style=\"width:29.7665%\">--</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Bootleg Turn</em>: A bootleg turn maneuver is when the Pilot uses the vehicle’s handbrake to quickly stop, spinning the vehicle 180 degrees, and presumably continuing on in the opposite direction. This is an excellent maneuver for breaking pursuit by an unfriendly vehicle, but in turn is a very harsh maneuver for a vehicle to perform, resulting in the vehicle requiring a Push against two components.</p>\n<p><em>Burnout</em>: The burnout is a special maneuver where a vehicle pilot breaks the grip of the wheels on the road, allowing them to spin without moving the car. On paved or hard surfaces like asphalt, this causes the tires to heat up due to friction and generate large clouds of smoke. On surfaces like loose earth or snow, it can throw a lot of material behind the vehicle instead. In either case, performing a burnout creates an effect like the fog cloud spell, lasting for as many rounds as the burnout is maintained.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;white-space:pre\"> </span>Burnouts become more difficult to maintain the longer they last, causing the Pilot DC to maintain the burnout round-to-round to cumulatively increase by 2. They require a Push to two components, the Transmission and the Chassis, but only if the burnout ends due to a failed Pilot check to maintain it.</p>\n<p><em>Drift</em>: Drifting is a special maneuver where the pilot intentionally breaks traction on the rear wheels and oversteers in order to corner without losing much forward momentum. Once a drift is established, a drift can be maintained over many rounds, making it useful for slaloms or avoiding attacks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;white-space:pre\"> </span>Attacks made against a drifting vehicle suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, and the drifting vehicle receives a 25% reduction in Turning until the drift ends. Drifts become more difficult to maintain the longer they last, causing the Pilot DC to maintain the drift round-to-round to cumulatively increase by 2.</p>\n<p><em>Dodge</em>: When an attack against a vehicle is made, the pilot may attempt to maneuver the vehicle in such a way as to cause the attack to miss. This is a straightforward maneuver, able to be made as a reaction once per round - the pilot makes a Pilot check with a DC equal to the attack roll result of the attack made against the vehicle. Success means the attack simply misses. A dodge maneuver has no effect against area of effect attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Handbrake Turn</em>: A handbrake turn maneuver is when the Pilot uses the vehicle’s handbrake to make a sharp 180-degree turn without losing forward momentum. Successful completion of this maneuver will allow a Pilot to effectively halve the vehicle’s Turning in order to make the turn.</p>\n<p><em>Jump</em>: A jump is when a vehicle finds itself airborne as the result of running off a ramp or cliff. This has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to a vehicle, so great care must be taken in performing such a maneuver. This maneuver requires a Push against two separate components. The DC begins at 10 and increases by 2 per 5 feet the vehicle falls, then is reduced by the vehicle’s Reactivity.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;white-space:pre\"> </span>While jumping, a pilot can attempt to flip the vehicle. While this is mostly for style, it will give the vehicle an effective +4 to its Armor Class for 1 round. This increases the Pilot check DC for the Jump by +4.</p>\n<p><em>Launch</em>: A launch is when the Pilot attempts to accelerate the vehicle from a standstill as quickly as possible. This is a difficult maneuver to perform, as it requires finding the right balance - accelerate too slowly and you’ll have a weak launch, but accelerate too aggressively and you’ll break the grip and just burnout instead. A launch is required whenever attempting to perform a full XLR8 from Speed 0.</p>\n<p><em>Shake</em>: Perhaps the simplest maneuver, a shake is nothing more than attempting to shake loose unwanted boarders to your vehicle. This can take on many different forms depending on the vehicle, such as shaking a ground vehicle back and forth, doing a simple roll for an aerial vehicle, or intentionally increasing chop for an aquatic vehicle. Depending on how they describe their effort to shake off unwanted boarders, the GM may see it fitting to grant a bonus to their check equal to the vehicle’s Reactivity, Brakes, or other stats.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>The pilot makes a Pilot check with the listed DC - if successful, their Pilot check result becomes the DC to hang on for all unseated and unbuckled creatures or objects on your vehicle. Bear in mind: a shake makes no distinction between friend or foe, and will affect all unseated, unbuckled creatures and objects on the vehicle.</p>\n<p><em>Stoppie</em>: A stoppie is whenever a ground steamhorse decelerates quickly while the rider shifts their weight forward, bringing the vehicle up on its front wheels. This is most often done for show, but can be an effective maneuver in combat in the hands of a skilled steamhorse pilot.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>In combat, a stoppie can block attacks from the rear, allowing the vehicle to take damage that may be intended for its occupants. This can be done as a reaction at the cost of a +4 increase to the Pilot check DC. If successful, the vehicle is considered the only recipient of the damage. The stoppie lasts one round, unless maintained, granting full cover to its occupants from the rear.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Stoppies can be maintained over several rounds of continued aggressive braking, increasing the DC by 2 cumulatively per round. Stoppies automatically end if a vehicle reaches Speed 0 or stops braking.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Performing a stoppie obstructs the occupants when looking behind them, effectively blind them as to what is behind the vehicle.</p>\n<p><em>Two-Wheels</em>: Something of the halfway point between a stoppie and a wheelie, a vehicle can be brought up on its two side wheels as well. This is most often done for show, but can be an effective combat maneuver granting similar benefits as a stoppie or wheelie. When initiating a two-wheels maneuver, the pilot must decide which side wheels to lift - the left-side wheels, or the right-side wheels.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>In combat, a two-wheels maneuver can block attacks from the lifted side, allowing the vehicle to take damage that may be intended for its occupants. This can be done as a reaction at the cost of a +4 increase to the Pilot check DC. If successful, the vehicle is considered the only recipient of the damage. The two-wheels maneuver lasts one round, unless maintained, granting full cover to its occupants from the lifted side.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Two-wheel maneuvers can be maintained over several rounds, increasing the DC by 2 cumulatively per round. Two-wheel maneuvers automatically end if a vehicle reaches Speed 0.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Performing a two-wheel maneuver obstructs the occupants when looking to the lifted side, effectively blinding them as to what is on that side of the vehicle.</p>\n<p><em>Wheelie</em>: A wheelie is whenever the vehicle accelerates so quickly as to lift the front of the vehicle, bringing it up on its rear wheels. These are oftentimes undesirable consequences of accelerating too quickly, but can also be done intentionally, most often for show as a demonstration of a pilot’s skill in handling their vehicle.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span>In combat, a wheelie can block attacks from the front, allowing the vehicle to take damage that may be intended for its occupants. This can be done as a reaction at the cost of a +4 increase to the Pilot check DC. If successful, the vehicle is considered to be the only recipient of the damage. The wheelie lasts one round, unless maintained, granting full cover to its occupants from the front.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span>Wheelies can be maintained over several rounds of continued aggressive acceleration, increasing the DC by 2 cumulatively per round. Wheelies automatically end if a vehicle reaches its Top Speed or stops accelerating.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);white-space:pre\"> </span>Performing a wheelie obstructs the occupants when looking forward, effectively blinding them as to what is in front of the vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong>Replace a Reflex Save:</strong> In response to any attack or effect that would require a vehicle to make a Reflex save, a pilot currently piloting a moving vehicle may instead make a Pilot check in place of the Reflex save. In this case, the outcome of this saving throw is also the result of the pilot’s saving throw - if the vehicle fails, they both fail, though this may not have any ill effect on the driver.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong>Action:</strong> </span>Varies. Most Pilot checks will be made as part of a Pilot action, which is typically a move action.
