This is accomplished with a small cavity in the back of the bullet filled with a brightly-burning combustible material, usually magnesium shavings. Unlike the other available cartridges, this is a modification that can be applied to all other anti-materiel rounds. Tracer rounds make it easy to spot the target you are shooting at - all ranged attack rolls against a target struck by a tracer round enjoy a +2 bonus on the attack roll for the rest of the round. However, it also makes it easier to locate the shooter, providing a +20 bonus on any Perception checks to discover the shooter&rsquo;s location.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.25,"price":15,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":"1","value":"1"},"broken":false,"hardness":5,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Anti-materiel Cartridge, Black-Tip","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"ammo","extraType":"gunBullet","baseWeight":0.25},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QDctKjgxMhBuBDIp"}},"_id":"xpNRwBUzC7L0yxL7"}

This explosion is so strong that it cannot be resisted by anything, turning all of the damage from the round into force damage. The explosion also releases a tremendous amount of rapidly-dissipating radiation, creating an area of low radiation in a 5-foot radius spread surrounding the impact site with no degradation. If hit by the round, the target suffers a -4 penalty on the Fortitude saving throw against the radiation. Black-tip metal cartridges have the Destructive quality when fired. They cannot be purchased by normal means, and cannot be crafted.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.1,"price":10,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":"1","value":"1"},"broken":false,"hardness":5,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Metal Cartridge, Black-Tip","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"ammo","extraType":"gunBullet","baseWeight":0.1},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"In2xLaPZGv8dRTFr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QDctKjgxMhBuBDIp"}},"_id":"yJhNcuwFYDsg3q5c"}
